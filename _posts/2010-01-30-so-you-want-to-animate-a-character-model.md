Open a finished model (such as Default_Male_Human) and merge the animations model.  Use the Merge Animation option (File -> Merge Animation, select “AnimationsModel.ugh”, and click Open, select all the animations you want to copy, and hit OK).  Your computer may hang a little at this point (there are a lot of animations), but don’t worry, leave it alone for a little while and it will come back.  Your model will now have all of the animations from the animation model included in it!
