I re-activated the Unseen Studios community forums which we used during the development of Evidyon from the days of "Project Volucris" (2006) all the way up to the end of 2009. They're all locked, as the new home of the game is EviTales, but if you want to look at who was around for the game's production and all of our crazy ideas, there are more than 12 thousand posts to browse!
