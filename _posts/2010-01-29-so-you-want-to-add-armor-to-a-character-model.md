Creating the armor is the hardest part.  I have included in the complete pack the bases for armors in the Model Creation -> Armor Creation folder.  To make these, I basically took the original model without armor and scaled the model to be bigger, then placed the expanded model over the original one and retextured it so it looked like armor.  If you open up any of the completed armors, you can see how the vertexes below the armor are deleted so that they don’t clip through.  It’s really a process that can be learned best by messing around with already completed models – try putting spikes on the shoulders or kneepads on the legs and see how they animate, then work from there!
