I just uploaded a [10-MB pack of graphics files](https://sourceforge.net/projects/evidyon/files/Evidyon%20-%20Website%2C%20GUI%20and%20Icon%20Graphics.7z/download) (mostly PSD, but also html pages, css, and other images) that were used to establish Evidyon's in-game GUI and give it its unique look.  If you're itching to re-skin Evidyon or use the original logo for something, this is what you need to do exactly that.  Enjoy!
