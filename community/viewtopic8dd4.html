				<div class="content">As of right now we are still working on the XP jump levels. But I think its probably a good idea to begin to think about the standard attack forumla for melee weapons. This will probably be long and complicated.  Here are our factors:
<br />Character level
<br />Weapon base damage
<br />additional weapon damage. from special stuff
<br />Strength
<br />Weapon type
<br />Character's skills
<br />Magical buffs
<br />any other damage enhancing effects.
<br />small random effect.
<br />
<br />I am too tired to start constructing the formula right now. We will work on the other formulas later. (defence. chance to hit. Xp from kill. etc)</div>

				<div class="content">Well the old system of damage was based more on level, not stats.  I am unsure where you are going with his, but balance should be a huge consideration, as well as a system that eliminates a single build type (I hate carbon copy characters)
<br />
<br />
<br />Character level - this should adjust damage by one point per
<br />
<br />Weapon bases damages - these should have smaller variations, so that a top weapon will not own everyone
<br />
<br />Strength - adds one per, plus an additional +1 for bonus structure
<br />
<br />Weapon type - not sure the meaning of this, but I'd say any non-trained weapon will be only 4% effective for each point in the skill to a max of 25 points 100%
<br />
<br />Character skills - each point of a skill is = 4% of total bonus  
<br />
<br />Magical buffs - 1 point per buff 
<br />
<br />level 10 versus level one with a club 1-4 damage
<br />level 1 3-5 damage
<br />level 10 17-20 damage
<br />
<br />this would keep things quite close, so that most times a single hit won't kill, as long as the level difference is not too large.</div>

				<div class="content">uhm, this isnt exactly what Im looking for. 
<br />I was trying to come up with the actual formula for calculating damage. 
<br />using skills in a% fashion is a good idea though. That way a highly trained character can really dish it out compared to someone who has wasted their skill points.</div>

				<div class="content">actually make the skill points, add a slight percent but a larger percent hit bonus. say you have swords maxed out you get 75% chance of a hit bonus</div>
