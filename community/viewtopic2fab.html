				<h3>PSA: When Posting Suggestions and Bugs</h3>
				<div class="date"><img src="styles/prosilver/imageset/icon_post_target.gif" width="11" height="9" alt="Post" title="Post" />Posted: <strong>Tue Oct 27, 2009 8:47 pm</strong></div>

				<div class="content"><blockquote class="uncited"><div>Yes I completely agree.  Make gear more realistic. In the end a leather should still be a leather, and plate should still be a plate.  Right now the armors look <span style="font-weight: bold">fruity</span>.</div></blockquote><br /><br />I know the quoted text above isn't as bad as some that have shown up on this board, but it's a disturbing trend that is reminescent of Thayerism.  I'm reminded of people who go to publishers with their books, and get furious when &quot;everybody wants to stick their spoon in my pie.&quot; It's fustrating enough to deal with professional criticism on piece of work that you've dedicated yourself to making a bestselling work.  This is a hobby for the developers, and they've opened themselves to the suggestions from anyone and everyone.  They patiently reply to issues they have discussed before, over and over again.<br /><br />That said some helpful trends to pick up when making suggestions.  This is based off what I've seen developers respond positively to.<br /><br />1-Be specific, if something is lacking, try to discuss the specific issues that could be improved.<br />2-Give specific but open minded improvement ideas.  This is not an oxymoron, if you want a good example check out <a href="http://www.unseenstudios.com/community/viewtopic.php?f=29&amp;t=3044" class="postlink">Marzuku's post here.</a> People have been very critical of armour designs, but Marzuku's post here is not likely to offend developers.<br />3-DO NOT USE COLORFUL LANGUAGE.  I'm not talking about swear words, I'm talking about the undescriptive hyperbole's like <span style="font-weight: bold">fruity</span>.  There just isn't much that a developer can do in response that is helpful.<br />4-If you don't think your topic is appropriate for the above criteria, then talk about it with other players.  Take notes, brainstorm, and remember this simple rule of thumb.  <span style="font-weight: bold">If there is no data, there is no problem.  The developers can't fix or comment on abstract concepts.</span><br /><br />When reporting bugs, think of it like the five W's of news<br /><br />Who? Who was involved? Who did it happen to? Don't assume the Developers know what characters you play.  Remember you have up to five of them too.<br />What? What happened? <br />When? When did it take place? Make note of your time AND time zone.  If this is something that was logged in the system it will help them find it.<br />Where? Where did it take place? The monsters and the background can help, if you know the scene's relationship to any major artifacts or portals, that helps too.  The official name of a map usually shows up in the top center of the screen when your ported, that helps too.<br />Why? Why did it happen? You often don't know, but if you have a theory, don't be too hesitant to share it.<br /><br />Most of the time, anything and everything helps. The developers aren't likely to get too offended over anything posted here, but it is a beta test.  The goal is to try and improve things.  Hopefully the above helps some of you who don't understand why you sometimes feel heckled by the responses provided by other players or the developers.<br /><br />[Edited to remove an unnecessary surplus of information]</div>
