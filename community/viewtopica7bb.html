				<div class="content">I'm thinking that after AP exams are done, we should email all those people in the memberlist and get them to come sign up.  Let's do some advertising.
<br />
<br />I'll release our MapView demo and write a few more tutorials at that point so people have something to play with.  I'll see if I can get Deto to release a song or two.
<br />
<br />And the most interesting part:  contests!  We should have contests for people to design interfaces, come up with quest ideas, help us write the storyline, etc.  We could give out custom titles or other board-based perks for a prize.  (help me out on this one...)  Or maybe they'll just do it for fun.  But I'd like to see some action on these boards!</div>
