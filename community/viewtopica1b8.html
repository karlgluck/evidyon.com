				<div class="content">Much like Ej's systems spells have weaker and stronger forms, tho not labled minor, major, omni, etc<br /><br />When you get the first form it has a base dmg + modified by your int at the cost of a low mana amount<br /><br />When you level up this form becomes base dmg + modified by int + modified by level and the mana cost remains the same.<br /><br />When you get the next form of the spell level increases no long effect the older version.  It will still increase in power if you increase int, but in order to justify the increased damage of leveling up, the mana cost has increased.  You still have the ability to use the weaker spell if you'd like to sacrifice damage for mana, because the old spell is still there, but you also have the stronger mana consuming spell available should you suddenly find yourself well stocked with potions, or if you are built so that mana is not much of a concern for you.</div>

				<div class="content">The formulae would be awesome just out of curiosity, especially since the entire formulae would include hints as to what else could effect magic damage that hasn't been discovered, lol.<br /><br />What I would like to know is(in addition to wether or not my Noctum connundrum is intentional.) <br />It's been rumored that there is a cap to how much you can put in a stat and still have it effective. Could this be confirmed, and if so is this only untill classes are balanced?  If there is to always be a cap could we please know what it is or have it so we can't spend a stat point beyond that point. I understand the importance of exploration but after lvl 24 that adds up to a 100k+++ Mistake everytime you experiment across that line.  Atm I am hesitant to pursue what I consider my ideal build, in consideration for that barrier.</div>

				<div class="content"><blockquote><div><cite>Morn wrote:</cite>Atm I am hesitant to pursue what I consider my ideal build</div></blockquote><br /><br />a) There will be a stat reset after all balancing has been completed (as stated by Karl)<br />b) The &quot;cap&quot; of a stat is more like an exponential decay curve. (example: <!-- m --><a class="postlink" href="../../people.sinclair.edu/nickreeder/eet150/PageArt/exponentialI.html">http://people.sinclair.edu/nickreeder/e ... ntialI.gif</a><!-- m --> - ignore the labeling of the axis, just the shape of the graph)  Each additional point will give you a smaller and smaller increase in attack speed/damage/magic/whatever as you proceed farther down the curve.<br /><br />On this note, keep in mind that DPS is Damage/Second.  For example, if you are a warrior, then you might want to consider not putting all of your points into either strength(damage) or agility(speed) because at a certain point (I'm not sure of what that point is, mind you) it will be more beneficial to your DPS to put your point into the other stat.<br /><br />Let's make some numbers up!<br />e.g. 150str 10agi warrior currently has 1000 damage on a 2 second delay = 1000/2 = 500DPS. +1 str will give +1 damage and +1 agi will give -0.1 delay, so:<br />Strength option: (1001)/(2) = 500.5 DPS<br />Agility option: (1000)/(1.9) = 526.32 DPS<br />so it would be more beneficial for that warrior to put the point into agility at this stage.<br /><br />I'm not sure what the real numbers are, but you get my point =P<br /><br />[edit] grammar</div>

				<div class="content">Let me add to this by saying that the decline is not the same over all levels.  Having 25 agility at level 1 will not give you the same speed as having 25 agility at level 100.</div>
