				<div class="content">A character named Warrior_Tal is botting lol.  I found him above the entrance to the south dungeon.  He was doing like 3-4 spins then 1 heal killing all the hellhounds that spawn around him.  He was doing this for a good 2 hours before I killed him and now he is just laying there.  I guess hes not auto logging because the bot program is still trying to spin and heal making him active?</div>

He would keep spinning/healing even when there were no monsters around him and he was doing this for about 2 hours (Probably more) in the exact same spot.  I tried to talk to him but nothing.  Then when I killed him, he did not auto log.  Looks like botting to me.</div>

I've hacked into a phpBB forum before, but rather than do anything malicious I left a note in the admin panel alerting them of their vulnerability.  I was curious about the mechanics of the exploit and had no interest in personal gain, other than knowledge.    It's not like he's a chronic botter.  This is the first time that I know of him botting in any game.  I can't vouch for his actual intention, just what he told me.  He said he would report it/suggest a bot detection system/delete the character.  I wouldn't allow him to keep a botted character anyways as I think it's extremely unfair <img src="images/smilies/icon_lol.gif" alt=":lol:" title="Laughing" /> </div></blockquote></div>

He didn't find a glitch or a bug to report; Karl knows how botting is done so there is nothing to turn into him. This was just a person botting and when he got caught he was going to cover it up, say sorry and go back to playing legit.
