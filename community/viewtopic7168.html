<br />As for myself, I am not actively involved (at this time) in the development of PV, other than some peripheral discussions I've been having with Karl.  I hope to have a more active role in game development once summer rolls around.</div>

				<div class="content">You are converting it to MDX/.NET? Wow, what a waste. You certainly aren't going to get a performance improvement, and MDX2 was killed by Microsoft. Be wary of what your idea of the future and Microsoft's idea of the future is. That being said, I wish you luck on that effort.
<br />
<br />As for the X file loader...that is a dog. =\
<br />
<br />I have written an X parser before, it isn't a lot of fun. Then again, it was ANSI C and ran under Linux. I don't know what predefined APIs MDX has, but if you are going to use MDX, you are pretty much locked in anyways, so you might as well use the API they give you: it will probably drastically reduce the complexity of the problem.</div>

				<div class="content">Well &quot;team&quot; would imply more organization than is really present.  At this point we have more of a &quot;loose coalition&quot; of contributors led by myself and Thadius.  I am developing most of the root code in the hopes to hand over more of the development control to Thadius in the future once he gets up to speed.

				<div class="content">Well, at one time I remember the BTR (can I say that here?) team had a large number of people involved with it, and I wanted to know how many developers actually followed your lead on this project. Not a whole lot from what I have seen, but that is OK.
<br />
<br />I mostly enjoy reading through open source projects, sometime contributing small amount of code. I have made a few (personal) changed to things, ported a few programs where ports did not previously exist, and submitted code for others. Small, things usually...
<br />
<br />However PV isn't open source, and I don't think it should be. I would like to see what the current state of the code is however, and this is impossible. Damned shame that is how it all works out, but some projects just don't work as well open-source. =\
<br />
<br />Maybe you could sometime give me a technical rundown of the current state of the project sometime? While I prefer OpenGL/UNIX/C, I have a much more than passing familiarity with Direct3D 9/Win32/C++.</div>

				<div class="author">by <strong>figgles</strong></div>
				<div class="content">Sorry about the terms. By technical rundown, I mean a large overview of the extremely technical bits.
<br />
<br /> For example, TCP or UDP communication, or both? Client single or multithreaded? Fixed Function or Pixel/Vertex shaders, or can switch between the two? Engine as DLL or static link? Renderer as DLL or static link? Server: single or multithreaded? Collision detection? Database or flat files? Pancakes or waffles?
<br />
<br />You know, all of that great stuff. If you had to explain to another programmer some of the design decisions were, what would you tell him/her? The answer is likely rather lengthy...</div>

				<div class="content">Ahh I see.  Well, as much of the code is undeveloped, the technical specifics are rather lax at this point.  However, I can address all of the examples you gave <img src="./images/smilies/icon_smile.gif" alt=":)" title="Smile" />
<br />
<br />likely, both (UDP for in-game, TCP for connectivity)
<br />single-threaded client
<br />both fixed function and vertex shaders (min vs1_3). no pixel shaders.
<br />engine, renderer, networking, etc, all statically linked
<br />collision detection on a very grainy basis--no model-based detection, 2d collisions only on the flat plane (circle, box)
<br />flat files
<br />depends
<br />
<br />Hmm...more specifics?
<br />Platform: Win32
<br />Target OS: Windows XP
<br />Graphics: DirectX 9.0c
<br />Audio: OGG-Vorbis
<br />Input: Win32 (yup, you heard me)
<br />Network: Winsock...bleh

				<div class="content">Sounds fairly decent. I'm not sure what other kind of networking you could use on Win32 based systems other than Winsock, unless you consider Winsock to be the WSAXxxx() functions and not the BSD functions.
<br />
<br />It does scare me it a bit that you wrote &quot;<span style="font-style: italic">likely</span> both&quot; rather than just &quot;both&quot; for the protocol. <img src="./images/smilies/icon_wink.gif" alt=";)" title="Wink" />
<br />
<br />How tightly integrated is the graphics/networking/input into the application?</div>

				<div class="author">by <strong>Karl G.</strong></div>
				<div class="content">Although I am doing some housekeeping on the code to separate rendering/etc. from PVs more specific code, I'm not being religious about keeping distinct barriers between them.  At some point, you have to come to a middle-ground just to get the damn thing to work.
<br />
<br />I'm saying likely both because it's possible that I will use TCP for logon procedures, etc, if it is easy and fits in nicely with the rest of the code.  If it isnt, well, away it goes.</div>
