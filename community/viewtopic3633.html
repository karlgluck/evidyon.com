				<div class="content">well has someone that played xenimus since day 1 of it hitting the internet<br />i can remeber when figs ruled xenimus. and the people on there were alot nicer.<br />i think the main problem with xenimus right now is ej is undecided about the <br />direction he wants the game to go in. the biggest issue is whenever he test<br />a character and someone comes along and pks him he gets mad and<br />changes the way that stats work.which would be good but if you do<br />somrthing so that chars can reset their stats.it also use to be alot harder to \<br />level on xen but now tou can get level 25 in a day. so leveling holds no value<br />now.and y do you have non drop non trade gear when you have magic<br />bags this just doesn't make any sense.i mean he has alot of work to do <br />to get this game out in stores.their are alot of problems with the game<br />and ej isn't very friendly on the game or in person. he always thinks<br />that someone is out to get him. im not bashing him just posting my opionion.</div>

				<div class="content">LOL that's exactly what I was thinking as I was reading that post.<br /><br />There's really no small things that can be done to make Xen hit any kind of shelf except by burning it on a CD and throwing it.<br /><br />Xen has gone so deep into a state of fubar that it would take a ton of programming and revamping a lot of different aspects of the game to make it good.<br /><br />Fixing all of the problems with xen, getting a really good customer service going, redoing the entire xen website, adding better graphical interfaces, having an actual STAFF work on the game and help with player relations, ect... the list goes on, there's just so much.</div>

				<div class="content">I wasn't there during the early days, but the first time I played was about 5 years ago. The GvE wasn't the best choice out there under Ej's guidance, and there were multiple times where the -gogood/-goevil command was enabled and disabled. Following one of the times I lost a great friend/leveling partner to the evil side and it made things difficult, although we still kept great ties. <br /><br />One thing I do think we should use is the ability to turn our character's ability to pk on and off. Of course someone will still be able to kill you if they enable it, but it prevents certain accidents from happening if you're not trying to pk at the point and just grinding. Attacking a mob with a multi spell and, for ex., a lowbie exploring the area transes by and gets killed in the crossfire leaves room for misunderstandings. Also, pking would then always be a conscious act, and never done accidentally unless you leave your pk mode on carelessly, and people that didn't care for the system could leave it on all the time anyway.</div>
