There are only a couple of things holding back this release now: the biggest ones are no spell effects (so I can't even tell if they're working right...they might not be =/), no equipped items, no treasure, and the map needs to be reimported.</div>

It won't be Beta, but it will be the last stage of Alpha, the &quot;pre-Beta&quot; release.

				<div class="content">bad news:  <span style="font-size: 130%; line-height: 116%;"><span style="font-weight: bold">Characters will be wiped with this update ...</span></span><br />good news:  <span style="font-size: 130%; line-height: 116%;"><span style="font-weight: bold">But there will be no character wipe going into Beta.</span></span><br /><br /><span style="font-weight: bold">Details</span>:<br />Beta requires both a complete technical overhaul and a complete design overhaul.  <br /><br />The first, Karl has been working on for over a month.  The end result will be a game much more technically sound, with the capabilities and elegance needed for the future; this technical work is laying the foundation for Evidyon which will persist all the way into Commercial release.  I'll leave Karl to tell you exactly what this technical update will do for Evidyon, but it's pretty damn impressive.  <br /><br />The second, as we've said before, is necessary.  To quote my progress report from the end of May, &quot;everything that's in-game right now was just created at the last minute to test whatever code Karl had turned out for that particular update, and none of it is fit for a public game.&quot;  That is definitely true.  We've needed to do this design work for a while:  new classes, a new spell system, a new item system, a system of properties for the items, new spells, new items, new maps, new monsters, new equations for everything, and so on.  So while Karl finishes up the technical work, we're all meeting every couple days and pounding away at a solid design for the game.<br /><br />We had thought about doing the technical work first, and then once that was in place concentrating on the design work, but we realized that we'd have to waste a lot of time to make the current (poorly designed) version of the game run on the new technical platform.  So instead of doing that, we've decided to delay the release until we can release both at the same time.  This means, essentially, that we'll be releasing a <span style="font-style: italic">completely new game</span>.<br /><br />Because it will be so new, we'll have to wipe the current characters.  Another big reason for this is that we'll need to have the game as thoroughly tested as possible before we release Beta, especially critical design questions:  <span style="font-style: italic">do characters level too quickly?  too slowly?  do monsters give enough exp for their difficulty?  is the drop-rate of loot reasonable?  are there enough items?  how about the rate at which characters gain spells?  are the classes balanced?  races?</span>--stuff like that.  To answer these questions, we need a lot of people playing a lot, and all starting from the very beginning.<br /><br />Now we had already planned on wiping characters for Beta.  The above reasons are pretty compelling as to why we need to wipe characters for Pre-Beta.  To wipe characters twice in such a short time would just be mean.  And since we know that several people have stopped playing because all progress would be lost anyway at Beta, the solution to all this is obvious:  wipe characters now, don't wipe them at Beta.  This will also have the benefit of giving Alpha testers a head-start, so y'all can go into Beta already familiar with the game and with a good number of levels.  We're still planning a reward item for Alpha testers, so we'll give that to all players active at the end of Pre-Beta.<br /><br />So what's Pre-Beta going to look like, then?<br /><br />We won't wait until the new version of the game is *entirely* done.  Instead, we're making sure that we have the foundation firmly in place and the essential design work done.  We'll then release the game in a pretty minimal form:  no quests, only a small map, only a few monsters.  But because at that point almost all the coding work will be done for Beta, and most of the design work done, we'll then turn to adding content as quickly as we possibly can.  Expect very frequent updates, even daily--maybe even twice on some days!  That will continue up until Beta itself.  Just as important, we'll be actively asking for feedback as to what <span style="font-style: italic">works</span> and what doesn't in the game, and adjusting according to y'all's responses, trying to get everything in shape for Beta.  We expect the Pre-Beta stage to last only about two weeks.<br /><br />Right now we're not exactly sure <span style="font-style: italic">when</span> we expect to have Pre-Beta ready, but we'll be meeting today and hope to have an ETA by this evening.<br /><br /><span style="font-weight: bold">Sorry for the length.  I hope that answers some of your concerns.  If you have any questions, please ask.</span></div>
