Crystals break insanely easily, why would anybody make a sword out of one?<br /><br />Now DIAMONDS are another case.. Making a sword out of a very large diamond would be Awesome!<br /><br />But yeah, last I checked crystals would make a terrible sword, unless you made it a kind of sorc/magic sword that can amplifies magic powers.. Which would be a nice alternative to girly wands..</div>

				<div class="content">Patience, patience.  You may have been disappointed with the name of one of the first warrior &quot;epics&quot;, but there are many items in this update and I think that you'll find the names not <span style="font-style: italic">too</span> disappointing.  Although I will warn y'all that because we're planning for many more levels beyond 25, there are a lot fewer cool names in these same level ranges.<br /><br />But if you want to suggest names, go ahead.  If something you suggest fits in, we'll be happy to use it.  I just can't guarantee that we'll use it at a level you'll be able to achieve in Beta.</div>
