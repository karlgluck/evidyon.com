				<div class="content">Hi everyone!  This is what I have in mind for this weekend's update:<br /> - Kill that weird monster-spawning lag bug<br /> - Fix monster movement so they attack more intelligently<br /> - Add more kinds of monsters so everyone can have things to fight and the cool items can actually be found<br /> - Hopefully add a safe-square of some kind.</div>

				<div class="content">What's wrong with a sq? :p<br />Or do you mean the 'hopefully' part?<br /><br />Anyways, looking forward to this, imo the spawnlag is the most important issue (having more drops then just wristbands is cool too though, i start to run out of give-away items). :J<br /><br />Edit: I just read a thread about mirc/vent. How about a global chat in evidyon?</div>

				<div class="content">At this point I'm planning one safe zone where people spawn.  Everything else will be fair game; however, I played for a little while on an anonymous character and getting killed over and over is a little frustrating.<br /><br />Oh and by the way:  I'm working on a <span style="font-weight: bold">completely new</span> map that has about 3x more land, arranged in such a way that I can put in more balanced monster types and provide you guys with more variety.  <img src="./images/smilies/icon_smile.gif" alt=":)" title="Smile" /></div>

				<div class="content">Ok guys, new map is finished and I've set up incremental monsters from levels 1-2 up to 40. <br /><br />I don't know how long it will be until release now, though, because I've come up with a way of creating spawn that is a HELL of a lot easier than what I'm using right now and will let me create, update and control the map much more easily.  So... I'm going to go ahead and implement that first.</div>

				<div class="content">Coolies, that sounds good.<br /><br />Well i dunno if this is still helpful then: <br />I noticed the spawn in the 'graveyard' south of the spawning point is still pretty much non-existant (one or two of them strolling around). Sometimes it has full spawn though. Could it be that you have some kind of 'total monsters on map limit' that gets reached before the spawn there is filled up again? Because other places like the monstrosities or the newb areas around starting point have full spawn, and when someone else was on hunting in other areas (reducing the number of monsters) the 'graveyard' had spawn.<br />My other explanation was that someone logs in a few minutes before me, cleans the place and logs off <span style="font-style: italic">everytime</span> i'm going there (which seemed not very likely to me).</div>
