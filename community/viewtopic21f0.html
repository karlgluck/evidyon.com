				<div class="content">ok i have been thinking about this and wanted to know how everyone feels about it<br />maybe carl could put rare gems into the game and let them do something special.<br />like a black onyx for example would give you unlimited hp regen for 10 seconds or something.<br />and a red diamond would give you unlimited hp and mp regen for like 20 seconds.<br />and maybe yall can think of some more.any how just a thought. so let me know<br />how everyone feels about this ideal and feel free to make suggestions if you<br />have any.and if yall don't think it is a good ideal it will be ok. good luck<br />all and hope to see yall in the game</div>

				<div class="content">Your idea inspired me a bit... how about this?<br /><br />Being able to equip &quot;Runes/Emblems/Relics&quot; that grant a special ability for the whole time you have it equipped, with chances for them to break.<br /><br />Black Onyx could give +2 HP Regen, and a 'Frigid Relic' could give +5% Ice Magic Damage bonus.<br /><br />All of these bonuses could range from...<br /><br />+X HP/MP Regens<br /><br />+X% HP/MP Base<br /><br />+X% Damage/Magic Damage<br /><br />+X% Attack/Cast Speed<br /><br />+X% Bonus EXP<br /><br />+X To Hit/Defense<br /><br /><br />And quite a bit more.<br /><br />Each time the player takes 25% of their total HP in damage, the chance for the &quot;relic&quot; to break is activated... meaning if someone dies in one hit from 100% HP, there's 4 chances the relic will break.<br /><br />A death would roll a chance to break with an increased 15x chance to break... so a 1% chance to break on a roll would increase to 15% chance upon a death.<br /><br />With these two combined on a 1% chance to break, being killed in one hit from full HP would be a 19% chance to break right then. A 0.4% chance would be a 7.6% chance to break.<br /><br />Once a relic is broken it'll simply disappear from your equipment, but an animation could be shown in the corner of your screen or something signaling your relic broke.<br /><br />Only one relic can be equipped at a time.<br /><br />For the sake of allowing everyone the benefit of relics, low level common use relics could be used that give like +10 HP and +10 MP, +10% Exp for players under lv 8 (high chance of breaking), ect.<br /><br />What do you think?</div>

				<div class="content">sorry, i must admit that i did not read the whole thing.  However, i thought of instead of breaking, maybe there will be a job or skill or even shrine or merchant you can pay to recharge your item.  Say you find the rare gem, you either have a profession to turn it into a ring or necklace or put it into a weapon/armor (long term profession system) or you bring it to a merchant to do it for you (short term implementation).  The effect would wear over time where you can replenish it later, or even swap it with another gem.</div>

				<div class="content">Slapping gems into equipment pieces is something that's been done repeatedly time and time again... with stacked effects of the same thing... in my opinion it's overused and dulled.<br /><br />Allowing players to carry gems like this on them, to have effects and if one breaks, just equipping another one is a simple way players can have special effects on their characters without having to go through the whole socketing ur equipment, slapping a gem in, or whatever type of system other games have tried to get away with this... this would be as simple as equipping an LSA or a bag from xen... which a lot of people didn't have a big problem with.<br /><br />Why I chose breaking rather than recharging permanent:<br /><br />If it breaks, just equip another one... granted you didn't die and drop it, then someone took them; it's Simple.<br />I'd carry a few of 2 or 3 different gems on me, depending on what I was doing and if my current one broke.<br /><br />Allowing them to break would allow them to be in the game in good quantities... rather than making them really rare and rechargable, forcing only the richer players to own them, and not letting the player easily switch between them.<br /><br />If you want professions... relics could be made and sold to give other players benefits, sure.<br /><br />Making them break would also add to the &quot;crap!!!&quot; factor Xen used to have; if you end up in a really dangerous area, it's scary to think that if you DO happen to get out alive, your rarer prized relic might break if you take too much damage that fast, unless you can unequip it in time.<br /><br />In the Xen system (as an example) it's kind of hard to degrade +1 HP Regen on a relic if you've been using it for a while... unless you just have it a reduced chance it will actually regenerate during that second... or something...<br /><br />Worrying about constantly keeping your gems or relics recharged and full potential in all ways possible just adds stress to the game... it's the main reason why I don't like durability or World of Warcraft at all.</div>

				<div class="content">ok what i was talking about was not nessecary a socket item<br />but a rare gem that would help u in some way.<br />and if it is decided to use gems in the game then<br />have like maybe a red diamond {which i do have a pic of} be the rarest one <br />of all and do something really kool. for higher levels.<br />but for lower levels have maybe a white saphire that would<br />give hp and mp regen for like a min or so. the possibilites are endless.<br />but i really like all the feed back on this issue. and im just laying<br />the idea out there whatever everyone thinks is best for the game<br />then im down with that. and again thank you eveyone for yalls <br />feedback on this issue.</div>
