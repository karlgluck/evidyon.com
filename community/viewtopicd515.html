				<div class="content">Good news and bad news, well it is more like pain in the butt news.<br /><br />The GOOD news is that the game works now and all the spells are correct, if it says trans, you trans instead of sorc beam.<br />The animations were not aligned with the spells.  I re-compiled it 2 more times and didn't touch anything and it works now.<br /><br />The BAD news is that none of your quick keys are correctly assigned to the spells you had them before.  I have no clue why the key files on your personal computers are not aligning with the game, but all you have to do is go to your casting menu and re-asign all your quick keys. <br /><br />I tested everything and it works now, all spells and other modifications that I made.<br /><br />Good Luck finding the expansion.<br />p.s. Bring a Friend.  You may need backup.</div>

				<div class="content">I'm having some awful issues.  Whenever I walk a character outside of town I get a Visual C++ runtime error and crash.  I have done this with 3 characters and cannot log on with them.  I can log on to my other character, however I'm sure if I walk him far off the square I will encounter another debilitating crash.</div>
