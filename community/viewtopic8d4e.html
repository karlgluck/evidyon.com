				<div class="content">The legendary items are items that have their names capitalized, and are limited in number, they are not neccesarily the most powerful items.
<br />This is my list with my changes
<br />Sun Staff - high damage - Infinite MP only one.
<br />Moon Staff - high damage- Infinite MP- (1)
<br />Vis Gladius - Insane damage - Infinite MP, HP steal, HP regen, +10 to hit, other insane awesomeness (1)
<br />Sword of Skull - high damage, HP steal, HP/MP regen. Makes user undead [thats a Con] (1)
<br />Mystic Bone Mail - Very high protection, HP/MP regen. ?makes user undead? (3)
<br />Black Cloth - Insane protection - HP/MP regen (1)
<br />Staff of Winds - high damage, MP regen, can cast Mutatio Sanctus (1 or 2)
<br />Mystic Blade- high damage, throwable, can turn into blade. 
<br />Vorpal Sword - very high damage, instantly kills dragons. Looks kinda like a serratus. (3)
<br />----------------
<br />Elemental Maces (5 total)
<br />1 Elemental Fire mace - high damage, double damage to undead. fire damage (sets enemies on fire?) (1)
<br />2 Elemental Ice Mace - high damage, double damage to undead. ice damage. (Freezes enemies?) (1)
<br />3 Elemental Lightning Mace - high damage, double damage to undead. Electric damge. (lightning arcs among many foes?) (1)
<br />4 Elemental Dispell/Acid Mace - high damage, double damage to undead. [poisions enemy/dispells all buffs] (1)
<br />5 Elemental Sanctus Mace - high damage, quadruple damage to undead. (1)
<br />--------------------
<br />Earth Hammer - High damage, can summon golem bodyguards (5-10)
<br />Ice Blade- Med/High damage, ice damage, chance to freeze enemies (15)
<br />I propose the serratus be made legendary.
<br />Serratus - med/high damage - high chance of &quot;lethal&quot; hit - very fast swing. (30)
<br />Anyone else have ideas for legendary weapons? Did I miss any?</div>

				<div class="content">well it wouldnt freeze other players, only NPCs. 
<br />I dunno if making the lightning staff legendary is a good idea. its always been a vital part of the staff tiers.
<br />Staff
<br />Magic Staff
<br />Fire Staff
<br />Acid Staff
<br />Lightning Staff
<br />Lucranimus staff
<br />Mystic staff 
<br />etc</div>

				<div class="content">I always felt fire and lightning staves (esp lightning) needed buffs aswell, simply being different colors was a flaw in xenimus imo. Hopefully we can come up with some creative ideas for these elemental items to make them much more sought after and for that matter, more rare.
<br />
<br />I like the spread-lightning idea for the lightning staff although it may be easier to implement if you just made a new multi spell that becomes available to the staff holder rather than being built-in. It could turn into a hassle if your lightning strikes start to hit bystanders/noobs. A spell that functions like VGV/VFV but with powerful lightning bolts would be awesome. 
<br />
<br />If you are going to specialize these items though remember to do the same for swords and such. A lightning sword shouldn't give you a new spell per se, but a raise in dmg over other equal level swords and maybe a % chance to inflict shock or some other pvp effect would be more along the lines.
<br />
<br />These are just some ideas to hopefully convince a few of you who feel that just because so-and-so was like this in xenimus, doesn't mean thats how it has to be in PV. And in the case of elemental items, I feel we could improve them a lot.</div>

				<div class="content">Im totally in favor of making more lightning spells. Chain lightning and ball lightning and all sorts of varieties are great. I just dont think the lightning staff should be legendary. 
<br />Sure, make it give a damage boost to the holder's lightning spells. Add new lightning spells for wizards. (not warlocks) 
<br />Just dont make the item limited. 
<br />The weapons I described above are like &quot;Sun Staff&quot; not &quot;sun staff&quot; they are limited and very rare. 
<br />with 15 ice blades they could be considered only semi-rare, but once 15 have dropped, no more can drop unless one is lost. 
<br />I like the return of the specteral maces alot.
<br />
<br />
<br />--------------
<br />
<br />How about an &quot;Axe of the Blind&quot; a unique(only 1) high-damage axe that has a 10% chance to blind your enemy for 3 seconds or so.</div>

				<div class="content">I don't like the idea of having weapons that &quot;disable&quot; a player.  As soon as a player is disabled they break contact with the game and start to hate that aspect.  Avoiding the &quot;frustrated&quot; feeling--given by blindness, freeze, lag, spell delays, time limits, cool-down periods, etc.--is key.  The player should be able to do what they want and not have to wait for something before they can act.

				<div class="content">Agreed. Let's keep things as fast and fun as possible. Make pvp effects instantaneous. For instance, i'll refer back to the lightning sword example I gave above, say the sword has a 5% chance to inflict shock, when that 5% goes off player A will deal 200% dmg (150% of which is lightning dmg) on that hit. You could even use the original effect used when someone is hit w/ a lightning sword in xen where the player hit flashes white and you see the lightning bolts.
<br />
<br />Fire swords could have a 5% chance of burning protection, where the players protection drops by say 20%.
<br />
<br />Acid swords could have a 5% chance of inflicting Venumum, where the player recieves a strong DOT poison.
<br />
<br />Those are some ideas that would make for some freakishly fast-paced pvp, which is what the people want right?  <img src="./images/smilies/icon_twisted.gif" alt=":twisted:" title="Twisted Evil" />  So long as the effects aren't negative (slowing, locking, blinding, etc.) I think we can keep the pvp intense.</div>
