				<div class="content">Hello Evidyoners,<br /><br />School has been ridiculous for the last few weeks and I have had no time to do...anything...other than my class work.  It's literally been finish one project, start work on another with many days finding me in the engineering building working on stuff with a group up till midnight.  Things should get a bit less nuts this week though, and I've been working with Ryan to help him start getting updates out to you!  He's worked hard on expanding the maps (and dealing with my less-than-user-friendly tools) and there is a lot of new stuff that he's added for you to explore.<br /><br /><br />Karl</div>

				<div class="content">The updates are not out yet.<br />The good news is the game finally compiles and loads.  I am now able to start testing the mod and fix things as I go.<br />I cannot say when an update will be inplace, there are a lot more steps than I was ever aware of.<br />I will be meeting with Karl later in the week to get the mod finalized.  I am unable to upload the update to the auto-updater because Karl<br />has the tools needed to do that codded on his computer.  He told me that he will work on an application that will allow me to upload the updates in a manner that I would understand.</div>

				<div class="content">Correct, the update hasn't been put out yet--but everything looks good so far!<br /><br />Ryan--I've got the update uploader working so when you're comfortable with the mod we can upload it <img src="images/smilies/icon_biggrin.gif" alt=":D" title="Very Happy" /></div>
