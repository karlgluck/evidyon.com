				<div class="content">Hey man,<br /><br />I've tried to burn videos to DVD format before and let me tell you--there's really no good way to do it consistently.  If you're lucky, there are some free programs out there that will burn very specific formats with very specific encodings (try searching [url]sourceforge.net[/url] for dvd writer/dvd encoder/dvd creator).  To get your media into the right format, MediaCoder is the best tool out there.<br /><br />Good Luck!<br /><br />Karl</div>

				<div class="content">Actually, a way to get a high definition dvd burning experience every time is possible. I download all of my movies as dvd ripped avi files, so the full quality is still intact. The exact format of a ripped dvd is an iso image file, but those are much larger, as the typical avi movie is about 700 megabytes. After that I use Nero 9, but there are plenty of free programs out there that are just as good.</div>

It just had data on it with the format on it, but to play dvd's you just burned them onto the CD from the ISO so it's &quot;bootable&quot;<br /><br />But who knows.. I've only studied Computers for 9 years, how the hell would I know..<br /><br />Although I've never needed to put videos on a DVD since I can just play dvd's on my computer/pirate the movie and watch it on there.</div>

What I meant when I said that the exact form of a ripped DVD is an ISO image, I meant that, when burned, all the menus, features, and extras are still intact as the original DVD would be (if the file has not be altered), and not just the movie itself, which accounts for the larger file size of an ISO. Also, when dealing with AVI files, you have a better chance of coming across a file that has been converted to AVI, which serves the purpose of the file type, but doesn't necessarily hold the original quality. As for my personal experience, I've never come across an unreliable or damaged ISO file, although I cannot speak for you, or your bountiful wisdom.</div>
