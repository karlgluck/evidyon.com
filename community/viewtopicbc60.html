				<div class="content">I know this is probably a long shot and i hope this doesnt go down to bad, i spent alot of time working this out and actually thinking about the arena itself.
<br />
<br />Basically it is the simple team battle game we hae all played any enjoyed, flag capture. I'm sure your wondering how does this work in xenimus, well let me explain.
<br />
<br />Obviously you have 2 sides, There will be a minimum of 3 players each side to a maximum of 6 players each side each event. Now once we have 6 players join the arena, they are all asigned to a team (randomly if possible) so now we have an equally chosen 3v3.
<br />
<br />Q. What the hell can the flag be?
<br />A. Using models that were available with the map editor i have made what i believe to bea suitable method of recreating the flag, see screenshots lower down <img src="./images/smilies/icon_smile.gif" alt=":)" title="Smile" />.
<br />
<br />Q. How can a xenimus model be shon carrying a flag?
<br />A. they don't. however i was thinking when a character is in possession of the flag their Character name is constanly visible below the feet of the character as if you had right clicked it (Right click to display character name will be disabled in arena) the name could show up in a golden yellow colour or any better way that programming expertise can distinguish flag carrier.
<br />
<br />Q. What do you benefit from flag capture arena?
<br />A. Well i think there should be a reward system of which I am yet to think up, i have been extremely ill over the past few days, my head is pounding right now a si speak. so if anyoe has any reward scheme process's they are more than welcome. Untill i maybe figure one out myself at a later date and let you all know.
<br />
<br />
<br />
<br />Right hope iv not bored you too much, heres some shots of the arena. Hope its not that bad to you all.

				<div class="content">I like the idea of an enhanced arena system, not just CTF exclusively. Other ideas could include a battle royal type system (free-for-all), teams (2v2,4v4), etc.
<br />
<br />As for how the flag carry can be shown you could simply have their weapon/shield replaced with a 2h model of a flag.
<br />
<br />I definitely feel that their should be rewards to those who prove themselves in the arenas, maybe certain items (amulets, rings) that are non-world drops and give special buffs or attributes.</div>

				<div class="content">Bets is a great idea! Have a hustler outside the arena gates collecting bets. This still doesn't necessarily reward the players in the arena though unless they are betting on themselves. If I were to spend a lot of time in the arenas I'd like more then just some extra cash flow however, amulets/rings that build up as you gain higher status in the arena would be cool. Ex.'s Gladiator's Amulet: +5 Str, +5 Agi, +10 Cons. Slayer's Amulet: +10 Str. Sorcerer's Amulet: +10% AMD. Etc. Etc.</div>

				<div class="content">i had this idea along time ago that could work as an arena
<br />
<br />there are about 6-8 people in an arena, they are all given their own crystal at the start and when it begins they have to go and touch the other peoples crystals, the first one to own all of the crystals at one time wins
<br />
<br />if you are killed you are eliminated from that game 
<br />
<br />the crystals can beam you 
<br />
<br />i dont know if you should be able to trans due to people transing as fast as they can just touching each crystal
<br />
<br />
<br />tell me what you think</div>
