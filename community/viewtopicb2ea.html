				<div class="content">I think I brought this up in a different topic but I thought since it kind of came up again I would give it a shot..<br /><br />There is a pretty big problem in Xenimus itself (I think it is lol) or at least it was at the time, which is the experience Loss after you die, I didn't think it was very fun for a character to loose a large chunk of XP just from dieing once, maybe again from trying to retrieve their dropage lol, and I came up with this after playing a few other games.. Which is instead of &quot;Loosing Experience&quot; you would instead gain debt..<br /><br />(If you don't really know what this means you don't have to read the next line)<br />Which means if/when you die in game you instead gain debt (duh) and during this dept you can Still gain XP but at half the speed and the other 50% would go towards the debt (Or what ever amount would be better.. 40 xp /60 dept  30/70 70/30, I kind of think it should be 10/90 lol but whatever)<br /><br />This would stop all the de-leveling and since you already drop gear when you die, and I don't see why you should loose Experience as well as gear, it's just not cool (Although dieing shouldn't be a parade, unless it's in a PVP party  <img src="images/smilies/icon_mrgreen.gif" alt=":mrgreen:" title="Mr. Green" /> ) <br /><br />What do you guys think?<br />(I was thinking of making this a poll, but since this is just an IDEA for now, lets just talk about it  <img src="images/smilies/icon_rolleyes.gif" alt=":roll:" title="Rolling Eyes" />)</div>

				<div class="content">Well I disagree. Back in Xenimus people use to remove all of their gear and then go <span style="font-weight: bold">PK</span>. Since beam was so powerful you could kill people and if you died you would just instantly port back. Yes, de-leveling sucked but dieing should be a penalty. And a harsh one at that. A good way to implement negative experience but not de-leveling could be to have it queue up. Say I'm level 10 and I have 150k experience. Every time I die I lose 10% of my experience. However, this is not removed from your total experience. It's added into a queue so when you go to level you have to gain 15k experience BEFORE you can start adding experience to your total again. What do you think? And 10% is just a number, it could be anything.</div>

Cause you can loose your gear to, and I don't see why you would Loose BOTH gear and Experience, it's a simple suggestion.. I think dept would be allot better and allow people to enjoy the game a little more instead of being scared to just simply go level up some.. I know allot of people think it makes it a little more fun, and pretty much just add's risk to the game, but I don't think Evidyon needs to be a Sky Diving act every time I log on.</div>

				<div class="content">These ideas concerning the penalty a player suffers for dying (&quot;dying&quot; is from &quot;die&quot;, &quot;dyeing&quot; is from &quot;dye&quot;) all sound pretty similar.  Does it make a difference whether exp is queued up or the player suffers a slower exp gain for a while?  Same idea, different implementation.<br /><br />What we seem to be agreed on is that the loss of exp (and consequential loss of ability) was too severe in Xen.<br /><br />So do we want to discount exp loss altogether and opt instead for some kind of exp slow-down (that is, it still takes longer to reach the next lvl but you won't lose spells/abilities/hp)?</div>

Say you finally manage to kill this person they can almost instantly come back and start killing you again with nothing to lose. I'm for either system as long as it would stack?</div>

And plus if you actually die from a naked char, you deserve to lol. And plus if you die from another character you shouldn't gain a whole lot of dept, I'll say half as much?
