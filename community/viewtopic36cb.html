				<div class="content">Hi everyone, 
<br />
<br />This is my first post on these forums, so it'll also serve as a nicetomeetcha. I think this project is brilliant and definetly worth the trouble.
<br />
<br />I have been playing xenimus since 1999 and I think that the most uniting factor of (the people committing to) this project is that we all loved xenimus the way it used to feel before. And don't get me wrong now, I'm not shouting &quot;freedom&quot; with a blue face to a buncha scotsmen. I just think this project just lures in the right people.
<br />
<br />With that being said, I think theres one problem that can't be solved with only the decisions on what to resurrect and what not... The most difficult part to imitate from oldschool xenimus is the things we liked most. The feeling of a new weapon. The feeling of a different hunting ground. I think that the dumbest thing in this nu-metal xenimus EJ has going on is that *so many places are unused and ignored*. For instance wars, master wars and supers along with east, wiz isle, etc, etc, are a waste of space nowadays. By making lava imps they are made useless gear-wise made ridiculously useless exp-wise.
<br />
<br />So the key thing is not to have too much gear floating around (inflating the value), or exp-gimmicks like lava imps making a whole bunch of locations useless. Comradeship (that the early days are still known of) works only if people are dependent of each other. I remember buying a dragon sword for 5k's. Some made a ref's worth of selling the bloody thing to me, you know รถ
<br />
<br />So that's basically the point of view I'm bringing forward: it's not all about what to resurrect. You can have some semi-new things thrown in. It's about not having gear coming out of your arse...
<br />
<br />Thanks for reading, mates.
<br />
<br />Don't mind about the fucked up grammar. Im finnish.

<br />
<br />what you say about re-creating Xen is true.  I think it has been addressed here before (correct me if I'm wrong, Karl...).</div>

				<div class="content">It's been addressed, if not quite as directly.  I think it will take a lot of tweaking to keep the EXP/gear down but still make the game fun, but that doing so will be well worth the effort.  Fortunately, the maps will also be much more flexible than in Xenimus, so we will be able to remove/modify sections that don't mesh well into the rest of the game without too much trouble.</div>

				<div class="content">Really? I have a clear picture in my mind, that it was 1999. 
<br />
<br />I might be wrong tho. I remember Xenimus being the reason I went to the crappiest highschool in my town. I was 14 back then, and I'm 22 now so 2 + 2 equals...
<br />
<br />Shite, I suck at math. Damn nitpickers lol.
