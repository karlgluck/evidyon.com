				<div class="content">Xenimus has always had a very duelistic theme in it. However when EJ made an entire EVIL world I think it took alot of evil out of being .. evil. 
<br />Being an evil player is a solitary, hard existence. I do think that Scelest (PK town) should have an evil square and an evil guard, but thats it. Evil players should have only the benefit of killing other players at their discretion. The new scelest should be distant and difficult to travel to/from. You should not have the ability to &quot;make&quot; an evil character. All characters start good, and become more good/evil based on their actions. Evil players should have some quests/special spells/items to make being evil not completely useless.  Regular raids on PK town could be a lot of fun.</div>

				<div class="content">Yeah, and he should've at least kept the -goevil thing, because without it a lot of people come on trying to do that like a bunchy of noobs. I see atleast 2 a day on Xen. It's so annoying.
<br />But yeah, and whats up with making the evil guards so much harder too, out guards have elemental gear, and evil side has spirit and omni.</div>

				<div class="content">Also whats up with the random good side guards all over in ds hunting areas that are 1shot kill guards, such as death square almost lost my sovo 6prped on x3 cuz of gay bum guards in a nuetral zone.
<br />
<br />
<br />and the reason -goevil is off is because he has to maintain balance, he does put up notice the -goevil command works when it is nessecary.</div>

				<div class="content">GvE is not a part of PV.  Your &quot;alignment&quot; is more like Lawful vs. Chaotic (maybe I should change it to that!).  All player characters are &quot;neutral&quot;.<br /><br />This could actually lead to some interesting consequences; for example, Evil NPCs will attack all players and Good NPCs.  Good NPCs will attack chaotic players and Evil NPCs.  Neutral NPCs will attack Evil NPCs.</div>

				<div class="content">I really like Karl's idea of just using the alignment instead of GvE. But I would like to see more evil towns (like scelest) or something like them, for example trading outposts with merchants you can use without guards pounding you, and maybe safe squares (we are going to have those arent we?). That way, its not impossible to be evil aligned unless you're awesome and high level. But evil outposts might make it too much like the current GvE system, so I guess it has to be balanced in some way. Or maybe being bad should be the &quot;quick and easy&quot; way, with exp bonuses, or more quests, etc.. But on the downside everyone else wants to kill you  <img src="./images/smilies/icon_biggrin.gif" alt=":D" title="Very Happy" /> .</div>

				<div class="content">There will definitely be stuff for evil people to do (quest-wise and merchant-wise) but, as you said, the major disadvantage is that good players have the option of killing you, and good town guards will kill you.<br /><br />That said, all classes can be evil but the naturally good classes (paladin, cleric) will have big issues with being evil.  There were several balances with old Xenimus that, while they may have been complete coincidence, I really thought balanced the game:  clerics were easy to level and were very powerful vs. evil; however, if you PKed as a cleric, you very rapidly lost your power and thus PvP (although completely possible) must be used with discretion.  Paladins were better Fighters that lost their power if they became evil.</div>
