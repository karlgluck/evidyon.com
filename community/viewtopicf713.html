				<div class="content">I have seen people try to recreate old xenimus several times. The one I remember most was going to be called Aion Online or something (which oddly enough is the name of the upcoming MMORPG by NCSoft) and I remember how much work went into that. The projects were always dropped after a certain amount of time, so when I heard about Project Volucris, I didn't have high hopes. I was definitely wrong though because the Alpha release of Evidyon is far superior to any of those projects and is actually really close to old school Xenimus. <br /><br />Sure some things could be changed and more content would be nice, but I'm sure thats all being planned out. I think its pretty cool that we have a skilled enough programmer working on this and he actually listens to the community's ideas unlike someone else.<br /><br />Damn good job so far Karl.</div>

I'm glad you like it so far <img src="./images/smilies/icon_smile.gif" alt=":)" title="Smile" />  I'm putting a lot of work into Evidyon this summer and I look forward to seeing you around the forums.<br /><br />By the way, are you the thomeboy that made that really awesome rock track a while back?  I wanted to use it in an Evidyon promo vid <img src="./images/smilies/icon_smile.gif" alt=":)" title="Smile" /></div>
