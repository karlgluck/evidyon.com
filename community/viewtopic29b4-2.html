				<div class="content">HUGENORMOUS BUG FIXING!  Stuff tackled:<ul><li> Underground log-off/-on shows aboveground terrain</li><li> Items pulled from storage disappear</li><li> Items disappear in general</li><li> Fix HP/MP equations</li><li> newly created chars have stats reset and no way to reassign them</li><li> stats of lvl 26s broken</li><li> Raise max lvl and stop EXP gain</li><li> scroll reset </li><li> <span style="font-style: italic">speed boosts broken</span> fixed again</li></ul><br />I've done a bunch of testing to make sure this update isn't as sh!tty as the last one.  Sorry about that :/<br /><br />In this update, you'll have to reassign your stats.  Also, try making a new character.  I'm trying out starting characters with a lot more HP than they used to have.  I think this will let new players participate more easily right from the start, since they can pvp without 1-hitting each other, hunt monsters with more variable damage, and I can increase the range of weapon damage, armor and spell damages.  I leveled a few chars to 4 to try it out, and I thought it went pretty smoothly.</div>

				<div class="content">haha yeah so....this is actually a bug that the other crap was hiding.  there's an infinite loop occurring ... somewhere ... !<br /><br />This kind of bug is a huge pain in the bum to find.  With a debugger?  5 seconds.  But of course, it never happens on my machine!  Without a debugger?  I have to sift through thousands of lines of loop code &gt;.&lt;</div>

				<div class="content">I'm laggy too.  The server might be doing something wonky, I'm not sure.  I installed visual C++ on it to help debug, so maybe I'll try wiping that off to see if speed picks up.  Glad to hear you like the spell!  =D  Not quite a substitute for good ol' Beam, but it's in the works</div>

				<div class="content">it's pretty sweet.  looking forward to a proper beam.  <img src="./images/smilies/icon_smile.gif" alt=":)" title="Smile" /><br /><br />did you say you had cleaned up the way the game handles lag?<br /><br />I'm no longer disconnecting when I get bad lag, and I'm not sure if that's b/c of fixes on your part or just b/c I moved to a wired connection and am getting a more stable connection to the server.<br /><br />and, I hate to say it, but there's still an item bug:  items are disappearing from death stacks.  Full description in the bug list.</div>

				<div class="content">I didn't do anything to fix lag (unless I fixed it by accident....which would be odd).<br /><br />WAIT!  Actually, I may have fixed it by accident!  There's only about 25% of the scenery now, so maybe your compy's having an easier time loading it.<br /><br />The choppiness in-game is due to the server's hard-drive being badly fragmented.  I took the server down to run defrag; should be back up in a minute.<br /><br />Items are disappearing from death stacks eh?   I'm on it!  At least they aren't disappearing from storage anymore <img src="./images/smilies/icon_razz.gif" alt=":P" title="Razz" /></div>
