				<div class="content">Hey everyone,<br /><br />It looks like the server has only been backing up every few hours or so...which is really bizarre, since it's set to back up every 10 minutes.  This erratic outage and a recent crashes make me think it is actually the hardware acting up--the hard disk appears to have errors so I am putting in a service request to my hosting provider.<br /><br />As it stands, it was actually in the middle of a backup when it crashed which is *extremely* suspicious since the software I use to run the database and backup routines (sqlite) is known for its incredible stability.  It should never crash unless there is a problem with the hardware.<br /><br />Sorry about all this, keep in mind this is still beta.  Once this is all fixed I'll do something to make up the lost time.</div>

				<div class="content">He gave me back exp for the 18th crash because the server should have been saving but it was not. I asked him in game about it and since the server reset yet again that exp is gone. As far as I know I am the only one that has asked him about getting my exp back. I don't care about the items that I have lost I am more worried about getting my exp.</div>
