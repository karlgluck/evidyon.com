<br />
<br />There is no master to-do list that I've seen, unless it's on the private forum, in which case do you have to donate in order to see that?
<br />
<br />The sticky threads and the welcome threads are minimally helpful and confusing.
<br />
<br />So far it's difficult for new people to join this project.  If this remains the trend of organizing information on this project, you could fall into the same pattern in gameplay and thus alienate new players who have not been with the project or game from inception.</div>

				<div class="content">There is no master to-do list right now, as you said--we're mostly trying to replace everything.  The private forum is only for link exchange; no discussion occurs there.  I personally don't have time in the near future to reorganize (on top of coding I have 4 midterm exams and a 2800 word paper all due soon), although I'll take your comments into consideration when I do.  If you would like to help and assist others in joining, perhaps you could try looking through the posts and seeing what has been done and creating an overall task-list?  We have been replacing all of the content of Xenimus from the ground up.  I can tell you that none of the textures have been redone yet, none of the animated models are done--but we're getting those later--but Thad has been pumping out many of the scenery 3d models.</div>
