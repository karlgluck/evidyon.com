			<div class="content">Well, since i kinda asked publicly i found out that the majority of the players on Evidyon have not played Xen and if they did they played x2, meaning that they probably dont have the urge to kill any one.<br /><br />Guys, PvP wont develop if we dont fight eachother and test it out guys, on alpha all we did was pvp when we were at SQ and it was freaking fun, so im suggesting this to my fellow players, test out pvp and report certain balance issues between classes.<br /><br /><br />BTW, the balance scale between damage and gear/stats is kinda weak, a good player should be able to kill another player at same lvl at 3-4 hits instead of like 8 when obviously they will be able to heal when it takes so much time, i kinda liked the geosid healing from Alpha btw, we already got geosids.<br />Maybe make player vs player based protection less potent?<br /><br />Stun/stupify:<br />Warriors are melee characters so they kinda need to be up close to a target when it comes to killing it, a caster though would most likely trans like a tranny when it came to pvp, suggesting some spells that pin down targets for x amount of time, both classes could have one.<br />also maybe a stupify pot that puts some liquid poison on your wepon making the enemies attack slower by x %?<br /><br />Spell removal:<br />Dispell, we need a disp because some players enjoy buffing eachother before going into battle, and when the enemy player hits faster than muhammed ali you are seeing butterflies and being stung by giant bee's.</div>

That means with the time it takes for them to stop and heal or beam, I've killed them, even if I get tag teamed by three I can usually kill one before going down.  I think this is either balanced, or overpowered on my part.  Tho I think that we'll get some real insight into pvp once everyone is 30+<br /><br />EDIT- the real problem so far is pvp against your own class.  On both Adept and Warrior I tested, and in both cases it's a heal-fest.  I think with strategy any class can pvp any class, but pvp against your own class requires some skill and probably the element of surprise.</div>

			<div class="content">Hey the lack of a trans spell for warriors makes up for the low survivability of casters.  Right now someone like say Shupter can kill me in 1-2 hits because I have like 500 or so hp, and don't give me &quot;more cons less int&quot; crap because if defense is factoring into my spell damage then Shupter would be very difficult to defeat with his 900+ hp and he would still have the upper hand.  Besides, warriors can still get dozens upon dozens of trans wands from geosids - problem solved.<br /><br />There's so much factoring into PvP which is why more testing is needed to determine if all of these statements are really true.</div>

We talked about this a lot a while ago, and we've got some ideas as to how we might address the issue.  I don't know how much an issue it is currently simply because I don't get to play much ( <img src="images/smilies/icon_sad.gif" alt=":(" title="Sad" /> ) and when I do play I don't PvP.</div></blockquote><br /><br />ATM I am able to kill most mages with 5-8 levels of me without a problem, so long as they don't trans onto sq.  20 Agil on lvl 22 warrior.  That means with the time it takes for them to stop and heal or beam, I've killed them, even if I get tag teamed by three I can usually kill one before going down.  I think this is either balanced, or overpowered on my part.  Tho I think that we'll get some real insight into pvp once everyone is 30+<br /><br />EDIT- the real problem so far is pvp against your own class.  On both Adept and Warrior I tested, and in both cases it's a heal-fest.  I think with strategy any class can pvp any class, but pvp against your own class requires some skill and probably the element of surprise.</div></blockquote><br /><br /><br />well atm you are lvl 35.. and you kill me with 600 hp.. in like less than a second.. so a mage...... i doubt thats a good description of pvp.</div>

You, and those that argue against you, have a different idea of what &quot;fair&quot; is. Xenimus is not the only qualification for knowing what makes PvP fair and fun. If more people (or the developers) think the game is more fun one way, then it will go that way. If you don't like it, deal with it or leave. Second, this is not some pro-Xenimus-player exclusive game. It is BASED off of it, but may go in totally new directions based on different opinions, mostly the developer's opinions.(deja vus) Judging from the (actually more than 2) people that disagree with you, I think it will go in different directions. I'm not trying to say that you should stop posting, that would be rediculous. It does seem though that you have moved away from putting valid/plausible points out, and on to attacking (the... gaming credentials..? [lol?] of) other people. <br /><br />Before anyone keeps complaining about PvP, I think we need to pay attention to the notifications of a PvP arena that will significantly help in the ballancing. Complaining right now with no evidence to back it up, and no developers with much free time to look into it, will not change much (if anything).</div>

			<div class="content">No PvP aspects is a little exaggerated. My point is that most games do have them, you simply don't recognize them because you don't like the style. I wanted to point out they they are valid too, and may be seriously considered.<br /><br />Edit: Just a thought but, it's almost impossible to not get into a little PvP in Xenimus.  Even on the PvE servers people are allowed 1 free pk a day, and if someone starts a fight, you can pk again. Maybe people didn't play on the PvP servers because they didn't like the style, just as you don't like the style they are suggesting. If they didn't play Xenimus, I still think they would have played another MMORPG with pvp aspects (EVEN IF THEY ARE DIFFERENT, they are still there). Have you asked them that? Not enjoying your style of gameplay doesn't invalidate their opinions.</div>

I read your posts because we are a community of what, 15-35 people? I believe everybody reads everybody's posts. And I never said I played on PvE servers. Or Etc... I haven't carried any conversations with you. <br /><br />Your facts are opinions. &lt;- <br /><br />You get pissed when anybody doesn't agree with you. I'm just trying to get you to see my side but that is quite impossible. You are a very ignorant person. That's why your posts and views will never help anybody except yourself.</div></blockquote><br /><br />so you arent stalking me, why is it that message there personal?<br />and yes we have talked online, you just dont remember it then.</div>

			<div class="content">Stalking...? It just means he's an active member of the board. If he doesn't post on other topics (by which I mean ones you haven't posted on) it's probably because you say things very provocatively. You INVITE these arguments, I don't understand how you can see it as unexpected. It's personal because he quoted you in a reply, and you responded, etc... It's a conversation, nothing abnormal.</div>
