				<div class="content">I think making map model &quot;layers&quot; in order to put roofs on things is the best way to go.  However, I've found that this adds an interesting opportunity--even more easily, I can add a second layer of map to the world so that houses could have two stories, there could be little hills, etc!  What do you think of this idea?  I'm not sure how the look would work, but I'm just wondering if this interests anyone as much as it does me <img src="images/smilies/icon_smile.gif" alt=":)" title="Smile" /></div>

				<div class="content">sounds interesting, but how would the hills work?  It seems that with layers, the incline would be difficult to make work.  Can't fight on a hill's slope if there are two parallel planes as the only layers to the world...as far as two-story houses (or dungeons *not* in the mts) goes, though, sounds like it'll work fine.</div>

				<div class="content">I would think that there would be no interaction between the levels; you would have to be on the same level to fight.  The slopes would simply be walls that are sloped up to the next level, in which you can't stand.</div>

				<div class="content">A ton seem to be like that. there all smushed together. like the armor sign is like on a door and stuff. i think the best thing to do is to spread them out and add it so when you choose something it will highlight it.</div>
