				<div class="content">I was just running along, killing things randomly when I ran into a group of monsters... all I was using was I think spin attack and clicking.<br /><br />Suddenly my character &quot;warps&quot; and I see a skeleton running toward me, so I guessed the group was over that way.<br /><br />I run over there about 3 screens and the skeletons were running in the direction I was warped to... somewhat...<br /><br />I tried to kill them but I was simply walking through them with no damage inflicting... I don't think I killed them before I warped.<br /><br />They just kept running, even over the water. O_o<br /><br />RUN AWAAAAAAAAAAAAAAY!!!!!!!!<br /><img src="../../img.photobucket.com/albums/v354/DracoX2/runawaaay.png" alt="Image" /></div>
