				<h3>Evidyon Alpha 2 - NEW Download (Sat. Jan 24)</h3>
				<div class="date"><img src="./styles/prosilver/imageset/icon_post_target.gif" width="11" height="9" alt="Post" title="Post" />Posted: <strong>Wed Jan 21, 2009 6:40 pm</strong></div>

				<div class="content"><span style="font-size: 150%; line-height: 116%;"><a href="http://www.unseenstudios.com/evidyon/download/evidyon-setup.msi" class="postlink">http://www.unseenstudios.com/evidyon/download/evidyon-setup.msi</a></span><br /><br />This is the bug-fixed version of the initial release, which takes care of a bunch of different things listed over in <a href="http://www.unseenstudios.com/community/viewtopic.php?f=22&amp;t=1266" class="postlink">Cagen's bug post</a>.  Major thanks go out to Cagen for setting this up for me, by the way <img src="./images/smilies/icon_biggrin.gif" alt=":D" title="Very Happy" /><br /><br />This version is slightly incomplete, but I thought it would be best to put it out now because tomorrow I need to do some homework and probably won't get the time, although I will be tinkering here and there.  One of the things that will be most obvious is that you can't identify other player-characters, but you are able to identify yourself and all monsters.  That'll be fixed soon.<br /><br />Other than that, please tell me how you feel about the flow of the game right now.  Is it too choppy?  Combat too slow?  Melee suck?  I know I haven't implemented blocking yet, but within what exists I'd really love some feedback and a little direction on what I should be focusing.<br /><br />My &quot;big plan&quot; is to do some more background coding for the next release and get the stats menu (and other menus) up to snuff, implement merchants/bazaar/geosids and possibly parties and definitely add more spells, items and abilities.  This will be phased in over the next couple of weeks, as I'm looking to start open beta before spring break (in March!!)</div>

				<div class="content">Very nice Karl! This is 100% better ifnot more.  <img src="./images/smilies/icon_twisted.gif" alt=":twisted:" title="Twisted Evil" />  I've noticed one wird bug where some monsters kinda just freeze up but other then that it's great so far. I wish velo on warriors would last longer but it's still nice to have as is. Been running steady 45fps with no lag i can see anyway.<br /><br />~Enchantress <img src="./images/smilies/icon_exclaim.gif" alt=":!:" title="Exclamation" />  <img src="./images/smilies/icon_exclaim.gif" alt=":!:" title="Exclamation" />  <img src="./images/smilies/icon_exclaim.gif" alt=":!:" title="Exclamation" />  <img src="./images/smilies/icon_exclaim.gif" alt=":!:" title="Exclamation" />  <img src="./images/smilies/icon_exclaim.gif" alt=":!:" title="Exclamation" />  <img src="./images/smilies/icon_exclaim.gif" alt=":!:" title="Exclamation" />  <img src="./images/smilies/icon_exclaim.gif" alt=":!:" title="Exclamation" />  <img src="./images/smilies/icon_twisted.gif" alt=":twisted:" title="Twisted Evil" /></div>

				<div class="content">Well, they seem to freeze to the point i cannot even attack them. Also there is a place when you go south-east towards the red scorpions that i get stuck on. <br />When will the stats be enabled? Ah, i almost forgot... The big pillars by the graveyard and the new monsters you made, are they suppost to randomly teleport you between the two?<br />~Enchantress <img src="./images/smilies/icon_twisted.gif" alt=":twisted:" title="Twisted Evil" /> <br /><br />On a side note, i think i'm lvl 11 now <img src="./images/smilies/icon_smile.gif" alt=":)" title="Smile" /> go me!<br /><br />Edit: I just noticed another bug... If you drop more then one item from your inventory into a single stack all items below it will be deleted...   <img src="./images/smilies/icon_cry.gif" alt=":cry:" title="Crying or Very sad" />  poor bone armor/helm/broadsword...<br /><br />Edit: I found a Russet Aegis  <img src="./images/smilies/icon_twisted.gif" alt=":twisted:" title="Twisted Evil" />  +0 armor!

				<div class="content">Well, i'm playing as a warrior and as far as melee goes...kinda like xenimus at lvl 1 really. We need stats to tell really. Spin is pretty nice tho, i think the radius is kinda small but it works. The real problems i'm having now is the way monsters group up instead of finding a path to me.</div>

				<div class="content">What i'd like to see for warrior style fighting is something like wow has rage or energy.  They would both work for the pace of evidyon. I think energy would be best, also the mederi spell is worthless now.  Maybe like a battle shout that enrages you causing  a heal affect on attack.<br /><br />Edit: I should probably say i would never want energy to be used  on common skills like spin and nomal attack. I think battle moves kinda like ej has setup but make them much more powerful...with the energy to limit there uses like mana. Warriors really don't even need mana there are ways to bypass it...</div>

It's probably just a setting somewhere.<br /><br />I was just happy it installed something at all, but I suppose it's time to improve it a little <img src="./images/smilies/icon_wink.gif" alt=";)" title="Wink" /></div>
