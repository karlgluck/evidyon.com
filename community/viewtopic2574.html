				<div class="content">3 things right now, many more will be added:<br /><br />- sacrifice items to get geonite<br />- Use geonite to portal yourself back to square (I'm removing -recall).  Geonite cost is minimal.<br />- Use geonite to restore 70% of hp/mp instantly.  Geonite cost = max hp + max mp.  Regen rates will be cut to encourage its use <img src="./images/smilies/icon_smile.gif" alt=":)" title="Smile" />  Percentage of hp/mp means that  potions that restore hp/mp and regen rates still matter...a lot!</div>

Evidyon will have a currency--it's what I'm implementing next.<br /><br />I hear you about the HP steals.<br /><br /><blockquote class="uncited"><div>anyway, you had to go to a prop shrine to get these if you were lucky you would get 7 prop.</div></blockquote><br />I played xen, remember? <img src="./images/smilies/icon_smile.gif" alt=":)" title="Smile" />  For better or worse, I have all the props, item stats, types and special abilities memorized.

				<div class="content">Better drop (even if only by a little) at Trolls would be nice--I've been grinding there for a while lvling my new char (enjoying the AGI/INT config much more than I expected--Solomon's just too f***ing slow!  And it would take forever to lvl him into a decent AGI) and have found nothing at all worth mentioning.  It seems that Monstrosities and Spirits are the only things with decent drop (and even there I haven't found anything--though I haven't been there much, and others tell me the drop is quite good).<br /><br />Also, again on a different note, I'm pretty sure I got both Multi Ignis and trans (or was it another spell?) at the same lvl, which was rather low (6? 8?).  Should M.I. be at a higher lvl?  It just struck me as weird.</div>

				<div class="content">ok geosids these are really kool.never seen them in a game before.<br />but here is a suggestion.the prop shrine that xenhas is unique to that<br />game and sorta of easy for all to use. not a real challenge.<br />but here is what i was thinking maybe there could be some way <br />to sacrafice certain items to sorta socket an item you have.<br />for example maybe you could use a tiger eye and it adds damage to<br />your weapon or something.i mean we all talk about xen.<br />and the thing that it had but how about diablo wich was<br />and awesomw game. maybe we could use some of their ideas.<br />just some thoughts.</div>
