				<div class="content">I've been following the project since day 1 to be honest, but I've only been able to log in once in a very long time due to my schedule being very busy. I played recently for a while to get a feel for the game. Here's my likes/dislikes.<br /><br />Likes:<br />-Fast paced (teleport and instant cast spells).<br />-Good buff system.<br />-Nice animations (on enemies, not players). <br />-Nice effects, especially the ring around npcs/ guards/ players. <br />-Maintains a lot of the Xenimus feel.<br /><br />Dislikes:<br />-The ground textures look very weird. It's very hard to tell where an item is on the ground, it's sometimes hard to see monsters. I'm color blind (red/green, blue/yellow) so maybe that's part of it, but the ground just looks like vomit.<br />-The respawn is insane. This is a feature that's highly subject to change, especially since it's in beta, but currently It's unbearable. I felt like I never even had a break to open my inventory or check my stats. A monster would always spawn on top of me. <br />-Archaic account number system. Yes, this was from Xenimus. No, we don't need it. It just makes remembering your account information harder. <br />-I found myself laughing at my character's model. The only one I found acceptable (and not hilarious) was the Human model. <br />-Highly subject to change as the game evolves from beta but: There's very little reward for leveling up.<br />-Text box can't remain open while attacking.<br /><br />Also, while this has nothing to do with the game, the playerbase sucks. I couldn't get anyone to help me, let alone respond to me. There were 5 people online and they were too preoccupied with talking about Liches or something to even acknowledge my existence. It was like playing a single player game.</div>

				<div class="content">For a long while the game was very co-op.  Everyone was helping everyone, and it was discussed by a few of the active player killers that wouldn't even steal gear until the player base expanded a bit.<br /><br />Then overnight we got a taste of some classic attitudes, my gear got yanked when I asked for help, and suddenly it was go-for-the-jugular type gameplay.  This is no surprise of course, the game was designed to make this kind of varied gameplay possible.  Necromadon, people who want to be helpful and want to discourage the kind of cut-throat attitude you saw, have to band together and help eachother, much like Evidyon Kings banded together against the groups that chose not to join them during the PvP night.<br /><br />I foresee that when the map and player-base have expanded we will see areas of the game where guilds like Evidyon Kings will have dominance, and areas where Heroic players will have secured, and smite player killers of any alignment, so that they can help their friend level in safety.</div>

				<div class="content">Thanks for your feedback, we are taking it into account.  I definitely want to get rid of the # system, and once we expand the game's world more there will be much more reward for leveling up.  Additional players should help with that too.</div>
