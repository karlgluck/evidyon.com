				<div class="content">Well i thought that we should have Names for certain zone's ingame, zones of particular interest in quest/grind, the other zone's will most likely be named by the players.<br /><br />Well the idea came when creating a quest zone's  &quot;Where are you grinding solomon?&quot; Solomon &quot;Im questing at KoD(kingdom of decay)&quot;<br /><br />this is because if you where to ask a dude where he was grinding it would be alot easier to understand if it had a particular name.<br /><br />The name would come up when you entered the zone white/red/yellow text depending on hostile forces or enemies, and it would only show up in towns,Ds,Castles.<br /><br />an example of the text would be:<br /><br /><span style="font-size: 150%; line-height: 116%;"><span style="color: #FF0000">Entering Kingdom of Decay</span></span><br /><br /><span style="font-size: 150%; line-height: 116%;"><span style="color: #FFBF00">Entering the town of Tertius</span></span><br /><br />Also i recall there being a Free for all zone, which could be an example of a Red zone.<br /><br />this idea kinda reminds of Diablo II, and i know that but what the heck.</div>

				<div class="content">Hmm I agree, this could be an interesting way of telling people where they are.  Xen never really had good names for areas, but that was ok because its map was small and people could portal everywhere.  Thanks for the suggestion marz <img src="images/smilies/icon_smile.gif" alt=":)" title="Smile" /></div>

				<div class="content">It was my idea!<br />lol<br /><br />But I myself think it should /only\ pop that up when either you enter a town, a new server, or a questing place.  Not every single zone in the game.. That leaves nothing to the imagination.. Let the players name the zones.</div>

But fear not! the one server will be PvP under the rules of the alignment system--very PvP-friendly--and there <span style="font-style: italic">will</span> be a free-for-all zone (like your Underground) ungoverned by alignment.</div>

Almost shitting yourself wondering when/if somebody is going to show up, keeping your eyes peeled! Listening to everything around you.. Waiting, looking, tripping out.. And when somebody does show up (if their invis or not depends) and if they look stronger then you.. Chances are, YOU fucking CHEESE IT!<br /> <br />INTENSE! Best adrenaline rush ever!</div>

They are 3 servers (In the xen case) 1. PVP 2. semi-PVP and 3. DS pvp.

And I'm sure we won't really have one anytime soon..<br /><br />And boss's like that aren't usually on a timer, Usually EJ just simply spawned them randomly..</div>
