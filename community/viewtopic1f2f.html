				<div class="content">I am sure that not many people know me based on this name but I started xenimus in jan 01. My first real character being Orson. I just wanted to say hello to the community here and that I have been watching the progress with excitement. <br /><br />I do not have any programming skills to offer, however I would love to help in any way that I can.  I can play guitar and piano if you are in need of any type of music for the game. There doesnt seem to be much happening in that particular forum. Whats the status on music?</div>

				<div class="content">The status on music is that no one has really worked on any in a long time. (not meaning offense to the people that were working on it, you guys were doing awesome)<br />If you want to record a piece so we can check it out go right ahead, we'd love to hear it.<br /><br />We need these basic things at the moment:<br /><br />Intro music<br />Dungeon music<br />Town music<br />special are music (sorta like in jeloc or castle)<br /><br />Looking forward to hearing what you've got.<br /><br />-Thadius</div>
