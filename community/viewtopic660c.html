				<div class="content">I dont like the idea of players choosing the town to spawn in. Everyone would just pick aridus. (on that note: aridus should not exist in Volucris.) I think all players should spawn in Semel, and then as they journey outwards they can make any of the other towns their default spawn place. Maybe you can make it so that Players can say -markspawn to mark their spawn place. But you can only mark towns and castles/towers. (maybe something different for warlocks. They need a &quot;lair&quot;)
<br />
<br />The map should probably resemble Xenimus's map. But I think it should be scaled up. Big time. The oldest, original continent should take up the space of all of xen as it is. A walk from Semel to Terthius should take like 30 minutes. Other continents can stay but they should probably be devoid of towns. I like the idea of civilization being confined to one island and evil stuff everywhere else.</div>

<br />
<br />You are thinking about noobs too much. 
<br />Original Xen was not newbie friendly. I stuck around. So did many others.</div>

				<div class="content">vitriol, you are taking a wrong approach. there is a difference between the feeling and making an exact copy. 
<br />Why should Karl do the same mistakes that ej did? and this will be an improvment, and if that means noobs will come and play this game and actually stick with it, then that is not a bad thing. It seems like this game will be hard enough, maybe not as hard as old xen, but hard enough. and maybe even have a larger community then it was back then. the more people playing = the more money for karl = better servers.</div>

<br />
<br />Exactly.  There is no point in re-creating exactly what EJ did--even though Xenimus had its successful &quot;hardcore&quot; players, many people were turned away by the awkward/dumb aspects of the game.  I made players able to select their town because I know everyone does the same thing in Xen--you just make your char over and over until you spawn where you want.  Selecting a town just removes this issue.</div>
