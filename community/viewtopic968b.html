				<div class="content">Okay!  Animated meshes and animations now load in the game editor and client <img src="images/smilies/icon_biggrin.gif" alt=":D" title="Very Happy" />  Hooray!<br /><br />Unfortunately, there's still something wrong with the animations...they don't quite look right.  It's difficult to describe what's going on, but suffice it to say I have to muck with them a bit more before they'll be finished.  But progress continues!</div>

				<div class="content">Glad to hear it man.  Looks like this thing is really progressing.  Just make sure your boss doesn't find out that you're taking off work to code a game.  <img src="images/smilies/icon_razz.gif" alt=":P" title="Razz" /></div>
