<br />looks like a good way for me to work with c++ again...
<br />I got this from Game Developer.
<br />
<br />The only problem is that I don't have Visual C++, which is what this framework is built to work with.  Now, it seems that it could be made to work relatively easily with Code::Blocks, but I don't know how.
<br />I've always had the worst luck with compilers.  I don't know why, but every time I try to get going on coding on my own computer, it falls to pieces as soon as I get to the &quot;compile&quot; part.
<br />
<br />Argh.
<br />Karl, could you help me out with this one?  It seems like a very nicely set-up framework that could help me learn by making things easier for me, but I need to get it running first...</div>

Just make sure the CD doesn't go the way of the last one I lent you <img src="./images/smilies/icon_rolleyes.gif" alt=":roll:" title="Rolling Eyes" /> I'll try to find it and bring it to the meeting today.</div>
