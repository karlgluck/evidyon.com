			<div class="content">I'll try to keep this simple and explain only the functions that don't explain themselves.<br />The tooltips should explain a lot (e.g., what the various attributes do, what a spell does, &amp;c.).<br />Feel free to ask questions if you have any.<br /><br /><br /><span style="text-decoration: underline">Key Binding</span>:  <br />To bind a function to a key, in the menu system right-click on what you want to bind--one of the screens or menus from across the top, a spell/ability from the Cast menu, an item from the Use menu--and then press the key to which you want the function bound.  You'll see the bound key in parenthesis next to the function.<br /><br /><span style="text-decoration: underline">Chat</span>:  <br /><ul><li>To say something, press ENTER, type your message, and press ENTER again to send.  If your message is too long, the left-over text will remain in your chat bar, so you only have to press ENTER again to send the rest of what you want to say.  Local chat will display above your character's head, party and global chat will display in the top left corner of the screen with a tag indicating which type of chat.  All chat messages also show up in the chat log.</li><li>To open/close the chat log, press 'L'.</li><li>For global chat, prefix <span style="font-weight: bold">-</span> to your message (e.g., <span style="font-weight: bold">--is anybody on?</span>).</li><li>For party chat, prefix <span style="font-weight: bold">-</span> to your message (e.g., <span style="font-weight: bold">-where are you?</span>).</li></ul><br /><span style="text-decoration: underline">Groups</span>:<br /><ul><li>Evidyon supports parties of up to 8 characters at a time.</li><li>Party commands:  <span style="font-weight: bold">/lead</span> opens you for <span style="font-weight: bold">/join</span> which joins you to a nearby leader; parties are democratic, so if A leads B and B leads C, ABC are now a single party.  <span style="font-weight: bold">/close</span> stops you from accepting joins.  <span style="font-weight: bold">/leave</span> removes you from your party.  <span style="font-weight: bold">/kick</span> kicks out the nearest party member (again, democratic:  anybody can kick anybody).</li><li>EXP for monster kills is shared in a 5 level range, but you have to be nearby your party members to get credit for their kill.</li><li>If you're nearby a party member and he kills a player, you also get blamed (in terms of alignment) for the kill.</li></ul><br /><span style="text-decoration: underline">Alignment and PvP</span>:<br />If you are the aggressor (i.e. you attack a person who hasn't done damage to you recently) the damage the player who is being attacked is reduced based on your difference in level.  This effect only lasts until the player who is attacked fights back.  If you are not the aggressor in a fight, you cannot lose alignment--so defending yourself is consequence-free.<br /><br />You cannot log off if you are engaged in combat.<br /><br />If you are level 3 or lower, <span style="font-weight: bold">you will never drop any items</span> when you die.<br />If you are level 5 or lower, <span style="font-weight: bold">you cannot be PKed unless you fight back</span>.<br />If you are level 7 or lower, <span style="font-weight: bold">you will not drop any equipped items</span> when you die.<br /><br />All players who hit another good player before they die are considered killers, regardless of who actually dealt the final blow.<br /><br />A PK is defined as being a killer of a player with a non-evil (i.e. neutral or better) alignment.  You cannot PK an evil player.  Killing evil players does <span style="font-weight: bold">not</span> count against you in any way.<br /><br /><br /><span style="font-weight: bold"><span style="font-size: 150%; line-height: 116%;">Alignment System</span></span><br />You are allowed <span style="font-weight: bold">one consequence-free pk each 24 hours</span>.  If you go 24 hours killing only one person, you will gain a point of alignment.<br /><br />Every person you kill within a 24 hour period of your last PK will decrease your alignment by an increasing amount.  Let me give an example:  You kill a player.  Ten minutes later you kill again and lose 1 point of alignment.  Four hours later you kill again and lose 2 points.  Ten hours later = 3 points.  You wait 24 hours after that last kill, and the counter resets.<br /><br />For every day you go only killing 1 person, you will gain 4 points of alignment.  Inactive characters (not played for more than a few days) gain at a slower rate.<br /><br /><br /><span style="font-weight: bold">Bonuses &amp; Penalties:</span><br />- Good characters drop fewer items, evil characters drop more items.<br />- The square will not protect an evil character.<br />- Evil characters spawn in the swamp.  For those of you that know the map, the columns have changed to make this place more accessible.<br /><br /><span style="text-decoration: underline">Storage Merchant</span>:  <br />The guy standing on the square is a Storage Merchant.  Click on him and you'll see two lists:  on the right, items in storage; on the left, items carried (does not include equipped items).  All of the Characters on a single Account share the same Storage space.<br /><br /><span style="text-decoration: underline">Geosids</span>:<br />See the little green guy?  That's the Geoling.  Click on him to sacrifice items to the Geosids.  This gives you Geonite (rarer items give more Geonite), your total of which is displayed as a green number in the bottom right-hand corner of your screen.  Geonite is used to perform certain special abilities, which are listed in the Cast menu.  Right now there are two:  Recall, which returns you to the place where you last used the spell (at log-on this is set to town, if you're evil it's set to evil-town), and costs very little (5) Geonite; Vitalize, which restores your HP and MP, and costs an amount of Geonite equal to your current HP + MP.<br /><br /><span style="text-decoration: underline">Bazaar</span>:<br />You can access the Bazaar through the merchant inside the house just above the square.  You can list your own items for sale and buy the items of others.  Your first couple listings are free, but if you want to list more items concurrently, each one will cost you a listing fee.  The listing fee increases quickly depending on how many items you already have listed.  If there are more than 20 items in a category, the listing will automatically refresh every 30 seconds to display a new set of items.<br /><br /><span style="text-decoration: underline">Screenshot</span>:  <br />To take a screenshot, press F1.  The picture will be saved as a .png to your Evidyon folder.<br /><br /><span style="text-decoration: underline">Stacked Items</span>:<br />Right-click to split a stack of items in half.  Click stackable items to combine them again.<br /><br />I'll keep this post updated as things change.  Again, if you have any questions, ask, and I'll answer ASAP.</div>
