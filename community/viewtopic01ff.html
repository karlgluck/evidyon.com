				<div class="content">So, I have to get crackin' on my actual programming job so I can make some money for this semester (no more 12-hour programming days :/), but I'm going to be working on getting the client set up ASAP.  That means getting the compiler set up to get content into the game.  It works right now, but it's a bit...hacked together.  That's the next step.  After that, I'm going to get the new version of the server online and start doing some connection/account testing.  I've got all the underlying code finished already so things should go smoothly.
<br />
<br />See you around,

				<div class="content">In a few months I'm going to try to put together a better server and have it on a better connection than it currently has now (atleast a T1, and possibly dual T3's). How much bandwidth per client do you estimate the game will use?</div>

				<div class="content">I estimate 1 MBps to be sufficient for at least a year's development.  I hope to have around 100 people on the server simultaneously, but each client takes very little bandwidth:
<br />
<br />1MBps = 1000 kbps = 10kbps/client
<br />
<br />
<br />10kbps is actually pretty decent, allowing updates every 100 milliseconds with 1k of data, or every 50 milliseconds with 500 bytes of data.  500 bytes is probably the average size of a packet.  Now, this bandwidth will probably be required in each direction, so the total connection needs to be around 1MBps.  Of course, even my laptop running on a regular cable connection can support 16 simultaneous connections with ease so until we get into heavy development I don't think it'll be an issue.</div>
