				<h3>Equipment, spells and such</h3>
				<div class="date"><img src="styles/prosilver/imageset/icon_post_target.gif" width="11" height="9" alt="Post" title="Post" />Posted: <strong>Thu Feb 15, 2007 8:04 am</strong></div>

				<div class="content">I've been jotting down my ideas for equipment and magic and things of that nature.
<br />Here are some of my ideas:
<br />
<br />
<br />I think there should be some uniformity in equipment area, unlike in Xenimus where some sets have some types of items and other don't. Equipment is not necessarily limited to these types, but every set should include every type. There can be additions to the sets that are not in other sets though, sort of like mystic blade is in xenimus.
<br />
<br />Weapons:: Sword, Axe, Mace, Rapier/Short Sword, Dagger, Staff, Wand
<br />Body Armor:: Leather/Cloak/Robe, Scale, Plate, Chain
<br />Helms:: Leather/Hat, Chain, Scale, Plate
<br />Gloves:: Leather, Chain, Plate, Scale
<br />Shields:: Wooden, Buckler, Tower, Scuta
<br />
<br />Types:: Common (Unnamed), Sorcery (Magic), Magma/Inferno (Fire), Frost (Ice), Drake/Demon/Phoenix (Dragon), Venom (Acid), 
<br /> Lightning (Elemental, I figured since EJ doesn't use lightning, why not), Shaman/Enigma (Mystic), Specter/Wraith/Phantom (spirit)
<br />
<br />
<br />(not necessarily named this)
<br />Magic Spells Forms:: Missile, Wind/Gust, Nova, AOE, DOT, Single Target (no miss), Buffs
<br />
<br />
<br />So for equipment there would be a piece of equipment of every type:
<br />Common Sword, Common axe, Common Leather Armor, etc
<br />Frost Staff, Frost Chain Gloves, Frost Buckler, etc
<br />
<br />And for spells there would be a spell of every form for every type:
<br />Magma Missile, Magma AOE, Magma Single Target, etc
<br />Venom Wind/Gust, Venom Nova, etc
<br />
<br />
<br />Each type of equipment would give a damage bonus to that type, and also protection from that type.
<br />
<br />E.g., Magma Chain Helm: +5% Magma protection, +5% Magma Damage
<br />
<br />Tell me what you guys think of these ideas</div>

				<div class="content">Ok this is how I did the percentages. I started with a base of 100% for the sword, which is 10 max dmg on the lowest level, then increased by 10 each weapon type, then I calculated each other weapons damage from that, with axe being 111% of swords damage, rapier being 90%, etc all rounded up, then halved the damage rounded up for the min dmg.
<br />
<br />These are just the set weapons, other weapons can be made that are not set items.</div>

				<div class="content">can't we just stick to normal names... I don't want to play and go around saying Looking for ...blah blah blah...
<br />
<br />O i think we should do something like d2 then, if we going to do some of this stuff. You know how in d2 if someone gets all the items for a specific set you get a bonus to something. Well i think the same thing for Xen it would make trading for fun and the game more fun i guess.</div>

				<div class="content">Here's my stance on equipment--
<br />
<br />I liked how simple items were before all the prefix and suffix attributes were added (of leeching energy blahblah) to xenimus. It just became too much when combined with propping items. 
<br />
<br />I would prefer to stick to a system like old xenimus (regular items + props) and give items innate abilities according to their class (fire/lightning/mystic/spirit). For example lightning items could have innate's of +14% lightning dmg and 5% chance of shock (hit deals 1.5x or 2x dmg). An example for the spirit mace with a system like this could be +10% on heals and a +5% almus effect. Swords, Axes, and such could have different abilities that were more suited for the appropriate classes. 
<br />
<br />edit: *btw* we can use lightning, fire, mystic, spirit, etc. as item classes without worrying about copyrights (they're in just about every other rpg), certain items such as Lucrum Animus Staff and classes like Ominex and Dirus, however, would need to be renamed. When it comes to how items and spells work it's in my opinion keeping them similiar to oldschool xen is the best way to go.</div>

				<div class="content">i was woundering if it was going to be oldschool oldschool xen....such as no level reqs. just one spell not minor... tiron...ect. and the spells just get better as you level therefore not having such a long spell list. when ej put the different levels of spells  into the game i recall alot of people quiting because of it.
<br />
<br />spin for example. not minor, tiron, medius just normal spin. The higher level you are the more dmg the spell will do. Less confusion that way. Also Sci rings if they will be in PV they should gain them a level completly not just for spells, also for gear if there will be a level req.</div>
