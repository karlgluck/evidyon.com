				<div class="content">I was wondering if weapon/armor models could be animated. I think it could be pretty neat to have items that are more than just a static model, but I'd understand if it's not possible or at least not likely that it would be implemented. I just had some cool ideas about some weapons and stuff that would be interesting if they were able to move themselves. Like a serratus that &quot;waves&quot; if you know what I'm saying. Also could be used to add small things to staves like revolving balls or whatnot.</div>

				<div class="content">The short answer: yes, in the future.<br /><br />The slightly longer answer is that it would be annoying to implement right at this moment, and that the current system does support animated *textures*.  You can achieve the rotating ball effect by animating the ball's texture, for example.  Items could also have special particle effects attached to them (like dirus stuff does)</div>

				<div class="content">So, would it be annoying to implement it on your end? or on the modeler's end?  I don't think it would be too hard to model it.  I just don't know how much work it would be on your end :-/</div>

				<div class="content">On my end.  Animated models work completely differently than static ones, take up a lot more memory, and the system is only intended to handle animated NPCs/players right now.</div>
