				<div class="content">Do any one remember what T7 ds actually was for high levels?<br /><br />it was a source of high level trade and showing off high level equipment with the risk of being killed.<br /><br />im thinking there should be a max gold trade limit of 15k in bazaar so that after that you could sell stuff in a place somewhat like t7 ds.<br />When you get higher lvl the game should get even more risky, going to store transing, might get pkd with the stuff you are trading etc thats just hardcore.<br /><br />if everything is as easy as going to an auction house then what will happen with sq hugging?<br /><br />just asking:<br />1.BTW are you working with teleporting inn and out of houses?<br />2.maybe add new towns, etc? <br />3.Beards should show wether helmet is on or off. <img src="./images/smilies/icon_mrgreen.gif" alt=":mrgreen:" title="Mr. Green" /> <br />4.a pvping guard?(who kills people who r evil) dealing massive dmg.<br />5. Alignment <img src="./images/smilies/icon_twisted.gif" alt=":twisted:" title="Twisted Evil" /> <br />6. only be able to pickup like 5-10 items at a time(not sure if u have that)<br /><br />just stuff like that, and can you please put the skull sword into bazaar so i can buy it, grinded way to much gold!</div>

				<div class="content">What would we do without you Marz? <img src="./images/smilies/icon_biggrin.gif" alt=":D" title="Very Happy" /><br /><br />I couldn't agree with you maor!<br /><br />YES we need somthing like t7 DS!! Hell, you should remake t7/t7ds EXACTLY.<br /><br />1. Agreed<br />2. That can wait for now.. <br />3. lol..<br />4. PvPing guard is a MUST! Maybe just a few High DMGers, but a bunch of regular lvls couldn't hurt..<br />5. Alignment kind of goes with the pvp guard.. So this should happen first.<br />6. I think you should only be able to pick up 2-3 at a time.. (Depending on agility ;D)</div>

New, and I guess Xen needed it after a while, and EJ must have thought people were getting bored grinding, pvping, and wasting their life on a game that wouldn't even allow you to max out your level.. (Well It hasn't happened yet at least)</div>
