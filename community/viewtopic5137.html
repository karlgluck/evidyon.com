				<div class="content">So this week is probably going to be the worst week of the semester for me.  It's unlikely I will be able to get anything done on the game this week, but next week my schedule starts clearing up so I should have much more time <img src="./images/smilies/icon_smile.gif" alt=":)" title="Smile" />
<br />
<br />This week = 2 mid-term exams, 5 problem sets AND three shows of the production that I've been helping direct all semester (Rocky Horror).  It's going to be nuts!  See you all next week--I look forward to getting to work on the map importer for ya, zigg <img src="./images/smilies/icon_smile.gif" alt=":)" title="Smile" /></div>

				<div class="content">Hi there, I haven't been by here in a while but I must say things look like they are coming along beautifully.
<br />
<br />I hope all went well with your testing and what not. 
<br />
<br />I really like what I am seeing, you should expect a donation from me soon.
<br />
<br />Keep up the great work!</div>

				<div class="content">Hatebreed, thanks for saying hi!  It's always nice to hear from people.
<br />
<br />Well, last week went really well I'm happy to say.  I'm not quite out of the hot water yet (problem sets + another prelim coming up soon) but I'm MUCH more free than I was last week.  After I catch up on the less than 18 hours sleep I haven't gotten over the past three nights, it'll be back to work on Volucris <img src="./images/smilies/icon_biggrin.gif" alt=":D" title="Very Happy" /></div>
