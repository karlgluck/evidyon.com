				<div class="content">As you see there are red clouds on the rise on the horizon within Evidyon, and once this world you have created karl becomes a battle field i think it is in right time to create a link/guild system that is permament until kicked/leave.<br /><br />The Guild system should be nameable which is a cool feature.<br /><br />Within the system there should be ranks like f.ex the guild name and your rank in form like the the army has? <br /><img src="../../www.thesilentservice.net/ETQWDocs/_m/rank2.jpg" alt="Image" /><br /><img src="../../www.thesilentservice.net/ETQWDocs/_m/rank3.jpg" alt="Image" /><br />the symbol of his rank in the guild would probably be showing how powerfull this guy was f. ex you wouldent mess with the player named <br />&quot;Bob from the guild of Deviance which was ranked &quot;Supreme commander&quot; which would mean he had gear and maybe guild members.<br /><br />There Should be a Guild bank/vault like on wow for property enhancement items which are given to officers/members or whatever.<br /><br />and i had an idea about how the guild could be created, well at least 5 members of this guild you would be making would have to come with you to a castle and speak to the King there and shout out who they wanted to be leader of their guild at the same time F.ex 5 player shouting out one of the 5 players name when the king asks &quot;Who would lead this band you wish to form?&quot; and every one shouts &quot;Karl&quot; and he is made supreme commander.</div>

				<div class="content">I think your thinking WAY to far ahead.. Since we don't even have a link system yet, and your trying to submit a RANK idea?<br /><br />C'mon.. Gotta do this one step at a time<br /><br />First link ability<br /><br />Then a decent INTERFACE remove/kick people (Not just that crap Xen has where you have to be next to the character to kick them/add them)<br /><br />then you can bring up rank idea's lol<br /><br />but nonetheless, I think a link system would be very useful, but not till after beta.. There's allot more to add till links are even needed.</div>
