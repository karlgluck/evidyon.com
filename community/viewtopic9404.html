				<div class="content">I have about 4 screenshots of you on the ground when you were naked beaming me.<br /><br />You died in 1 hit.<br /><br />Stop flooding the boards? I didn't make this thread, you did.<br /><br />I thought Joe made it pretty clear when he locked the one i made, that he didn't want us arguing here, why would you make a new thread?<br /><br />Oh thats right, your so in-secure your worried about people seeing you got owned, so worried in fact you'd do anything to make ME look bad. When in turn i have about 15 screenshots now, of both your chars being killed by mine.<br /><br />All you have is like 2? The two where you supposed to have 0 geo's yet turned out having some and using them in our pvp. A pvp that was supposed to be no geo's.<br /><br />The more and more you continue this, the more you make yourself look pathetic. We get you've been playing for a while, we get you have no life so you choose a game over your girlfriend and life.<br /><br />I understand it must be hard going for so long without being owned, and then someone lvling for a few days, then owning you. Ok i really get it. But its a game dude, seriously.<br /><br />Your pathetic attempts of getting people against me have no effect, you even went so far as to logging on a noob and taunting me then saying &quot;hahah i got video of you saying you'll own me when im on a lvl 4, people are SO going to think your a bum now! haha they don't know im mm4&quot;<br /><br />I thought you were  going to accept the fact you lost, but i was wrong.</div>
