				<div class="content">I really liked it when you were able to run while spinning or healing, that would allow so much more to the game, as well as any other melee attacks or some spells...<br /><br />The spell delays stopping the character movement bogs down the player and is really annoying compared to having no spell delay.<br /><br />The only thing I didn't like about the no spell delays is if you go to cast a click spell a lot, faster than your character can actually cast it, it makes your character walk forward instead of staying still like u want it to.<br /><br />Is there a way to allow players to walk + cast, as well as make spells give the player a delay til their next spell... without making the character stop moving?</div>

				<div class="content">Yes, I've noticed that the delay isn't very fun to play with; however, the currently-implemented alternative is that when you cast a spell that turns your character to a new direction (midus, for example) while running, your character turns and runs in that direction.<br /><br />The fix is a bit complex but here's what I'm going to do:<br />- By default, spells do not halt your character<br />- Targeted spells stop your character from moving and turn your character, and introduce an &quot;action&quot; delay (so that you can't turn away from your beam spells).  The action delay is easily toggled on my part so if it ends up being crappy I can just turn it off.<br />- This is a bit more subtle change:  casting a spell and holding down then moving your mouse causes you to move (I think).  I'll fix this.</div>
