				<div class="content">That would be nice, what with a top-down game in which it would be difficult to look around for party members (can't scan horizon).  Perhaps it would be best to leave such indicators up all the time?</div>

Would the arrows of sensus be appropriate, or do you think it would be better to have a radar-type-thing?</div>

				<div class="content">arrows of sensus would be better for distance, if your following someone and they get off your radar your cold, where as with sensus you could continue to follow them.</div>

				<div class="content">Sensus arrows have always annoyed me a little bit...<br /><br />They stay up in the same positions they were upon sensusing, and they looked tacky and dull.<br /><br />I thought about a way to revamp the sensus system one time for EJ but never posted it anywhere.<br /><br />My idea:<br /><br />When you sensus, slightly transparent arrows 'shoot' out from your character in the directions the targets are... as the arrows shoot out, they become more transparent until they disappear.<br /><br />The length of the sensus would only be around half of a second, so the time it takes for the arrow to fade would be rather quickly... and the speed of the arrow shooting out could be dependent on the distance of the target... rather than having EJ's &quot;length&quot; of the arrow dependent on the distance.<br /><br />The further away a target is, the further the arrows will shoot from your character.<br /><br />Perhaps party members can show up as green on the sensus.<br /><br />I think this would be very nice for a sensus... it kind of implements a &quot;radar&quot; sense to EJ's classic system and would look better in my opinion.<br /><br />Also... if it's possible, please no spell delays or stopping the character movement on casting a cheap spell like this lol... maybe an animation and stop character movement but even in xen there was a small spell delay.<br /><br />If it's still hard to understand with the way I wrote it, I'll show an example or two using some animated GIF's.</div>
