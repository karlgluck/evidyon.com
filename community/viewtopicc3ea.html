				<div class="content">There were three of us this morning Heph, Swift, and fluffy kitten, and all of us seemed to be getting booted at trolls within 1minute of entering the area.. I hunted other areas for a few hours with minimal interuptions and I just went back to trolls when BAM, I got booted. I think that area is bugged.</div>

				<div class="content">I had the same problem at the newly discovered lich area. But then a few hours later It did it at the square. Each instance I crashed like, 5 times within a minute.<br />I'm not sure any one place is bugged, but I have noticed they seem to happen in bursts. I'll go for half an hour to an hour of nothing, then it'll crash 3-6 times, then go away again.<br /><br />Edit: BTW, karl if you read this, I still have a 30k penalty from crashing over pits... I think I talked to you about it during the earthen emblem event. If you would remove it, that'd be awesome. <img src="images/smilies/icon_smile.gif" alt=":)" title="Smile" /></div>

				<div class="content">Where exactly in trolls?  Having a spot that always does this would be a huge help in finding the problem.  And yes, I will take care of your penalty XP when this bug is found.</div>
