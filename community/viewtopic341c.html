				<div class="content">I've decided to release the next update today, even though it is not as complete as I had hoped.  I'll be posting the download once I redo the drops again--for some reason, when I import the game project file, it always decides to erase the loot and treasure.<br /><br />Here are some things it will feature:<ul><li>Fixed that stupid text bug where text would go all wacky sometimes</li><li>New chat menu and chat log</li><li>New controls for moving/attacking/blocking (<span style="font-weight: bold">you don't actually block attacks yet--sorry <img src="images/smilies/icon_sad.gif" alt=":(" title="Sad" /></span>)</li><li>You can &quot;stop action&quot; to get out of gas</li><li>Bows work!  No arrows though--they just shoot <span style="font-weight: bold">by the way, I need an arrow model!</span> <img src="images/smilies/icon_rolleyes.gif" alt=":roll:" title="Rolling Eyes" /> </li><li>Animation speed is now a factor of your actual ability speed:  if you attack slowly, the animation is slower.  It looks better and was something that had been bothering me <img src="images/smilies/icon_smile.gif" alt=":)" title="Smile" /></li><li>Your player motion is MUCH more fluid--(almost) no more jerking or popping while walking around</li><li>Screen tearing in fullscreen mode has been fixed</li><li>Repeatedly moving forward then snapping back when bumping into a monster/tree/mountain has been reduced</li><li>You shouldn't be able to get stuck in monsters now--I found the bug causing this</li><li>New character login screen and ability to delete characters</li><li>Monsters with low HP will flee</li><li>I adjusted the speed of movement and attacking for monsters and players.</li><li>Day/Night Lighting</li></ul><br />Stuff that I definitely am going to include but haven't had the time to set up yet:<ul><li>Configurable keys for bringing up menus</li><li>Trading</li><li>Bazaar</li><li>Geosids</li><li>Portals</li><li>Special item abilities</li></ul></div>
