				<div class="content">A couple strange things about this picture:<br />*  The &quot;leave bazaar&quot; button in the bottom right corner, as a result of the higher resolution.  Could that be placed closer to the window itself?<br />*  One must scroll down to see all of a &quot;page&quot; in the bazaar listing, and then flip pages to see more stuff.  It would be better to either have one long listing (no pages), or keep few enough items per page that one doesn't have to scroll.  Enabling the scroll wheel has already been mentioned.</div>

Now I'm getting some very strange behavior from the Bazaar:  It will fail to list items above a certain price, though minutes before I was able to do so:  for instance, I was unable to list a necklace for a price above 1002 gp, and then a few minutes later I was able to list one for 1020 gp, and now I can get one up to 1032 (but not 1033); before I managed to get a certain item (I forget what) to list for 3500 gp, now I can't get <span style="font-style: italic">anything</span> above 1032.<br /><br />Karl:  are you trying to limit list price somehow?

				<div class="content">And, while I'm spamming here (where's everybody else?  Why aren't y'all trying to break this thing with me?):<br /><br />There is currently no way for gold/goods to exit the economy other than by dropping (on death or otherwise) goods.  This will only lead to inflation as we try to test things.  Perhaps a weekly/daily &quot;tax,&quot; in which gold is deducted from each character (flat fee, or perhaps a percentage, maybe to a minimum amount), or gold is reset altogether?  Maybe implement a disposable and have the server sell it via the bazaar?<br /><br />I know this isn't the *primary* concern, but it might help testing if we didn't let things get <span style="font-style: italic">too</span> out of control.</div>

				<div class="content">Wow, that was a lot of posts!  Ok, here goes:<br /><br />The reason you can't list items is likely because you don't have enough gold.  Listing an item in the bazaar costs money.  I can disable this if it ends up being a pain, but there should be no limit to the price you can set (as long as you can pay the fee, which is approximately 1/16th of the price for all items over 1000 gold)  This could definitely be more explicit.<br /><br />I'll move the exit button.<br /><br />One big list would be impractical for several reasons, so I'll see what I can do about having them all show up on the same page.  I definitely agree that scrolling is annoying.<br /><br />The bazaardisplay.cpp error has nothing to do with money, I'm sorry to say.  It's good for me to know that it's happening, though (I thought I fixed that...).  If the bazaar starts doing weird stuff, just log off and log back in to reset it.<br /><br />I agree with you about the debug log thing.  I'd like to introduce a debug &quot;hook&quot; that can (optionally) print those message to the chat log.</div>

Anybody else having problems receiving cash payments?<br /><br />*  I'm still having trouble listing items after the first few.  This may be a per-session thing, but I'm not sure.  It may have something to do with listing a 2nd item of the same type as one you've already got listed (every time I recall having this problem it was trying to list a 2nd Russet Rapier or Aurelian Cloak).  And it for sure isn't a price thing--I tried listing them at 1gp and it still wouldn't take.  Anybody else having trouble listing items for sale?</div>
