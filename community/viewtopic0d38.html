				<div class="content"><img src="images/smilies/icon_exclaim.gif" alt=":!:" title="Exclamation" /> There is a glitch or problem with new warrior class characters.<br />I start out at 47 thousand mana, but there is no mana in the mana bar.<br />Race: Human<br />Class: Warrior<br />Level: 1<br />As I got to level 5, nothing had changed, it still said I had 47 thousand mana.  Plus since it doesn't regenerate, I am unable to cast fury.<br /><br /><br /><img src="../../i33.tinypic.com/2ccplxx.jpg" alt="Image" /></div>

That would be really helpful and should solve the &quot;MP&quot; issue.<br /><br />Edit:  then again if you were to get your wis/int to 18 just to use orbs(or even 22 for the higher tier ones), at what cost?  <img src="images/smilies/icon_razz.gif" alt=":P" title="Razz" /></div>

				<div class="content">Orbs aren't meant to be used with 2 handed weapons (otherwise you would be able to use an orb with dual-wielding, using a greataxe, etc.) so you won't be able to use them with bows or crossbows; however, you can always equip the 1h ranged weapons (knives, lightning bolts, etc) and use one.<br /><br />And as for raising your wis/int in sacrifice of another stat.. well that's just the joy of making characters eh? =)  You have to find your optimal solution and are not supposed to just stack agility until you have a 10-999-10-10-10 character.<br /><br />~Erich</div>

It's very easy to tell what your regen rate is:  look in your stats screen.  Every character has a base regen of +10 mp, +10 hp.  Then equipment modifies the regen rates.  That's it.  (Karl, Erich:  I'm not forgetting anything, am I?)<br /><br />The reason we're keeping it this way is for simplicity's sake.</div>

				<div class="content">Mana in Evidyon = The energy to perform special moves, either extravagant meelee attacks or arcane manuevers.  You should view it this way instead of looking at it as the manifestation of arcane force.<br /><br />Spellcasters recieve more base mana points because they do not use a steady flow of mana in basic meelee attacks, therefore every bit of their mana is measured.  With meelee you only measure the extra mana you can spare to do extra damage.<br /><br />This isn't a philosophy of the mechanics of the game, I am no authority to provide that kind of insight.  This is just my perspective that allows me to emerse myself and enjoy the game.</div>
