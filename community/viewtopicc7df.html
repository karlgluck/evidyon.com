				<div class="content">Right now what we have the players spawning into is essentially a round island with 3 villages, a road, and a forest. I think this is a good idea. New players should spawn on the &quot;newbie island&quot; where they learn how to play and get their first few levels. I was thinking that after a player gets level 5 he would get to travel though a harder dungeon with skeletons and maybe a volucris as the boss and the end would take him to the main big world that we have yet to craft. This is essentially a rip off from the first lineage: the blood pledge game. Gimmie some feedback.</div>

				<div class="content">great idea!
<br />The dungeon could sorta be like the great hall with waves of progressively harder enemies so you would possibly have to group up to complete it, and a final harder boss. (nice touch with the volucris there)
<br />
<br />At the end could be a port mark or a static portal(I like the idea of this) to the main world.</div>

				<div class="content">yeah, i was thinking at the end of the dungeon would be a portal that just never closes. (I am not a fan of port &quot;squares&quot;) 
<br />The mini-great hall idea is great. You could start with some aggressive giant bugs, then imps (if we keep those), the rogues, then trolls, some barbarians and thieves, followed by some skeletons, and then a volucris.</div>

				<div class="content">Great idea. I like the idea of having to group together to make it though too. And if you dont meet the level requirement, it wont let you in the dungeon or even out of the world. Which also kind of leads on to another thing. Would you beable to return to this other world in the future? Part of me says yes, and part of me says no. I wouldnt want people going there and pking newbs all the time.</div>

				<div class="content">It's a great idea for newbies, however once you have played a high level and want to make new characters it would be tedious to go through the newbie dungeon every time, wouldn't it? The noob dungeon reminds me of Fallout 2, where new character had to finish a dungeon before going to the real world. I must have created 10 new characters and that was my least favorite part of the game. Make it optional?</div>

				<div class="content">hmmm that is a very good point... perhaps you could have a basic game intro... like where a guard of some sort speaks to you... teaches you about how things work in the world... gives you a little area to fight bugs and imps to give you a first hand experience of how it works... and then gives you an option to &quot;would you like to stay and train, or would you like to continue to the mainland&quot; It would give those people new to the game the opportunity to learn about it and give those firmilar to it a way out... you could decline the intro speech just the same as the bug task in xenimus now..</div>

				<div class="content">this is something that could work GREAT with new subclassing!! 
<br />
<br />when noobs reach level 10 or so, they have to compelete an initiation quest to lock in thier finnal class. (kill the volucris &amp; go into port)at the end they would have to decide what class they become. then they would get ported to thier new 'home' town based on what class they chose.
<br />
<br />these class towns should be very small but should have Many quests specialized for your class/level.
<br /> 
<br />fighter town 
<br />(barbs/fighters)
<br />Holy town
<br />(clerics/pallys)
<br />wizard town
<br />(druids/wizards)
<br />warlock town
<br />(darkwar/warlock)
<br />Thief town
<br />(rangers/theives)
<br />
<br />of course you would have one major city. every 'class town' should have a port merchant that ports to the central main town.
<br />
<br />
<br />*on a different note i think thieves and rangers should be 2 different classes. thieves should be able to duel wield with 2 daggers or 2 short swords , or one short sword one regular sword. and rangers should primairly use bows.</div>

				<div class="content">Hey guys, you know that waterfall looking thing in evil-side Solus castle where the mystic merch is? the purple thing. Why not have Main portals to different towns or where ever look like this? a sold port that doesnt go away. and certain places require a lvl. also a sign that you can right click next to the portal teeling where it is to so we know where to go. and temporary ports will be a simpler version of this.</div>

				<div class="content">Personally i do not liek the idea for a &quot;class town&quot; as the game will not be hosting masses of people to begin with, therfore if people join and go to a &quot;class town&quot; this limits the amount of actual players that play the game they will see, untill they reach levels high enuf to go to main towns.
<br />
<br />I really like the idea of a Newbie get to know our game island. and when you leave you are transported to a town like Aridus, i think the game should be based around Aridus in the outside world just because it is the most xenimus related town that everyone knows and enjoys or did.
<br />
<br />thats only my thoughts tho</div>

<br />
<br />I remember this, but we might as well just have one small newbie town and wilderness, a graveyard, a cave or 2 surrounding it. With the exit temple located far away from the town.
<br />
<br />It doesnt really matter, but I do prefer the idea of concentrating the playerbase in one popular town. It used to be semel, then it was terthius for a while, then eventually everyone just hung out in aridus, which is what people still do.</div>

<br />And I dont think we will be bringing that back. It was always a dumb idea. Players should be hanging out at the capital, the most important city. 
<br />The way to do this is to provide merchants which sell items you cant get in other towns. that way one city will become the default city. but we are quite far from this, as for now players will be spawning on the newbie island, with no way off lol.</div>

<br />why does vitriol always speak like he is the creator of this game.

<br />and btw if theres a noob island like that, i will stop supporting this game 100%</div>
