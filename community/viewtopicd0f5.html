<br />Everyone is making all these cool dungeons which is fine, but we really need to get this starting continent finished.
<br />
<br />Since the old mapmaker maps aren't compatible anymore, the ones that were finished need to be remade.
<br />
<br />Just like in the old thread, post here what section you're working on.</div>

				<div class="content">I would try to make a map for a section, but I don't know exactly how to tell how many tiles I have gone in a specific direction... just out of curosity I tried scrolling on the map editor as far in one direction... and I ended up quitting on the scrolling because it seemed like it went on forever in all directions...</div>

				<div class="content">You are correct--the map editor is infinite* in all directions.  I wouldn't worry too much about making the things exactly the right size; if necessary, count them (i know thats a pain, sorry <img src="./images/smilies/icon_sad.gif" alt=":(" title="Sad" /> ) but it can always be fixed when the map is stitched together.
<br />
<br />I think a better idea would be to have people make &quot;areas&quot; and just fill in the stuff between them once the final map is put together.
<br />
<br />*The map can extend up to 2 147 483 648 spaces in each direction.</div>

<br />PS--i'm still trying to figure out how to do dirt-grass blending and water edges nicely.  I'm focusing on getting the network functional right now, though, so unless some idea smacks me in the face im not going to mess with it</div>

				<div class="content">Usually being the key word <img src="./images/smilies/icon_smile.gif" alt=":)" title="Smile" />  You can make dungeons in a completely separate map file, and we'll just stick them somewhere out in the black when it's all stitched together.  In fact, it might be better (for re-usability) if they were.</div>
