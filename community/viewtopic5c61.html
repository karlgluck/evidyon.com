				<div class="content">I'm trying to decide whether or not (and how much) to change the user interface of PV away from Xenimus, so can you all help me out by answering these questions?
<br />
<br />How attached are you to the way the main menu is laid out?
<br />
<br />Would it be a big deal if PV used a &quot;real&quot; font instead of the bitmapped Xen font for the menus?
<br />
<br />How about in-game?
<br />
<br />How would you feel about having real &quot;Windows&quot;-style dialogs instead of just having menu pages?  Would this be worth the extra two weeks it would take to develop?</div>

				<div class="content">You can't get worse than the xenimus menu design, so I say take the extra time and develop something good.
<br />Real fonts would look a lot better, and you would be able to scale the fonts to different resolutions unlike in xenimus, while also making text input more responsive.</div>

				<div class="content">i was very supprised to see when EJ made items in you inventory look like an item and not just typed out. 
<br />
<br />have you played xen FP? i really do like the start up menu where u can see your character and the gear he/she is wearing. altho some items dont show up properly and what not. its really completely useless and probably time consuming programing, but looks cool anyway.
<br />
<br />i say go for a nicer UI, 
<br />its better to have nice UI that you can understand.</div>

				<div class="content">Necro - that's why I'm having trouble deciding which approach to go for.  I think I'm leaning toward just doing the oldschool &quot;feel&quot; but with a redesigned menu layout--the menu system EJ used is really akward to code.  I'm going to set up a different (but compatible) method first, then see what you guys think.
