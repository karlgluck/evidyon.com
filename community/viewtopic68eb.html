This is when grinding the level 30 mobs.<br /><img src="images/smilies/icon_exclaim.gif" alt=":!:" title="Exclamation" /> The level 30 mobs I think do too much damage since there are about 3 - 4 in a room. The mobs I am talking about are the Liches and skeletal mages in the south dungeon after the phantoms. I have almost 800 hp and they do about 200 damage per 1 mob, so when I go into the room and try to attack one to get some life back they almost all kill me. Maybe these mobs are higher in the level 30 range than I actually thought.</div>

			<div class="content"><blockquote><div><cite>Joelshup wrote:</cite>-Strength seems to be a pointless stat. I would figure that strength would increase my melee damage, but I have noticed no increase what so ever. The only increase in damage that I get is from new weapons. If strength really did increase my damage by 1 - 2 points that's really quite small and insignificant. Especially when we are talking about casters doing the damage that they do now (sorry to point you guys out).</div></blockquote><br /><br />If strength is supposed to effect meelee, and int (or maybe wis) is supposed to effect mag dmg, my testing hasn't been able to confirm any effect.  I might make a few level ten character with vastly different stats just to test, but as far as I can tell, this observation holds true with adepts too.<br /><blockquote class="uncited"><div><span style="font-weight: bold">General Suggestions:</span><br />-The south catacomb dungeon shouldn't be geared towards casters only. I feel that you alienated the warrior class with this dungeon. I know I have to go get trans wands from my guild geosid, but what happens if I don't get any 3 - 4 times in a row that's a lot of wasted time trying to get trans wands or even tp scrolls for that matter. Since I feel that this is just a very lengthy and unnecessary process for me to just to get into a dungeon and either A. explore or B. level up I feel that you either should recreate the dungeon to incorporate the warrior class or have a merchant that sells trans wands and tp scrolls so I can just use my gold that just piles up. So I can have the ability to move around the world much easily.</div></blockquote><br /><br />Dungeons that are geared towards different classes creates variety in the game.  Granted it sucks in beta, where there is limited availability of hunting areas I think that making it so that every class experiences the same cost of difficulty in every area takes away depth in the game, and probably contributed to the downward trend of xenimus.<br /><br /><blockquote class="uncited"><div>-I feel that I should not drop my equipment that I currently have equipped when dieing. I do feel that dropping a random inventory item when you die is just, but not my WHOLE inventory AND half of my equipment that I am using. I would strongly urge you to tweak this system please. I think that when you die none of your equipped items should drop period. This makes it really hard for me to get my equipment if I don't have anything to survive long enough to get back to my origin of death. Also please make it to where we just drop 1 - 2 items in the inventory not all of it. When I was grinding in T2 troll cave I accidentally found the T3 troll cave and got man handled. I dropped ALL OF MY INVENTORY and 1 equipped item, I got very lucky. But please look into reworking this system it would make the game A LOT more enjoyable.</div></blockquote><br /><br />I think that the value of life is one of the core fundamentals of this game.  If they go down the same path as xen then there will be a rare and valuable item later down the line that will protect your equipped items.  and another that will revive you and give the chance to escape.  Taking away any of the death penalties would encourage you to hunt in places your not supposed to, if you are dying too often or having a hard time, then you should either not be hunting there, or should be hunting with another person or group.  Maybe even a healer.</div>

			<div class="content">I can see where you're coming from and does make some sense to make some dungeons for the most part geared towards a specific class like caster that would make for an exciting and dynamic experience.

			<div class="content">Wow!  Lots of stuff to respond to here, so I'll try not to ramble.  I've read everything, but I'm only writing about stuff I have direct answers to.<br /><br /><img src="images/smilies/icon_exclaim.gif" alt=":!:" title="Exclamation" /> <span style="font-weight: bold">Fury is missing it's tooltip.</span><br /><img src="images/smilies/icon_exclaim.gif" alt=":!:" title="Exclamation" /> <span style="font-weight: bold">Wrath is missing it's tooltip.</span><br />Fixed.<br /><br /><img src="images/smilies/icon_exclaim.gif" alt=":!:" title="Exclamation" /> <span style="font-weight: bold">Fury also seems to have a random buff duration I don't know if this is a bug or not.</span><br />Should last 30 seconds.<br /><br /><img src="images/smilies/icon_exclaim.gif" alt=":!:" title="Exclamation" /> <span style="font-weight: bold">It's been said before in another post that Fury seems overpowered. I would have to agree in some aspects (thinking of PvP of course) Fury could be quite overpowered. But I would also have to disagree with this suggestion as well. I say Fury's lifesteal percentage could be tone down a percent or 2, but nothing more than this. Fury is really the only ability that even makes the warrior have the chance of leveling up.</span><br />Looking at my code, this is definitely true.  Right now fury's life steal is set to &quot;10&quot; in the editor.  This was supposed to be a %, but I never divided by 100 so you're actually getting 10x life steal.  Happy accident?<br /><br /><img src="images/smilies/icon_exclaim.gif" alt=":!:" title="Exclamation" /> <span style="font-weight: bold">This has also been said in another post want to bring it in here.

This has been fixed.  Testing with a level 7 warrior wielding a club, 10 str ~ around 10 dmg, 18 str ~ 20-25 dmg, 25 str ~ 40 dmg.  Difference should be even more noticeable at higher levels.  Same goes for intel--that wasn't working either.<br /><br /><img src="images/smilies/icon_exclaim.gif" alt=":!:" title="Exclamation" /> <span style="font-weight: bold">I see that Whirlwind is based on the speed of your weapon. That is great but I think that Whirlwind should be a base speed and not be too fast like when I dual wield weapons I can spin insanely fast or not too slow like when I wield a 2h weapon. I think an equilibrium between both will make it a lot more balanced. It really is more beneficial to dual wield Whirlwind than it is to 1h/shield WW or 2h WW. I would think that it shouldn't matter what you use, Whirlwind should be the same speed. I don't if this was intentional or just a bug or something.</span><br />I'll look into this one--the reason I made whirlwind based on the speed of your weapon is so that players who use one weapon type aren't penalized where others get a benefit.  Other than speed, there would be no difference between 2h weapons and dual wielding weapons for almost anything, and since figs whirlwind often that's probably not helpful.  Try the update that comes out later this afternoon with the str fix and the 2h weapon fix and I suspect this will be less of a problem.  Ditto for the whirlwind being weak issue.<br /><br /><br /> <img src="images/smilies/icon_exclaim.gif" alt=":!:" title="Exclamation" /> <span style="font-weight: bold">The south catacomb dungeon shouldn't be geared towards casters only. I feel that you alienated the warrior class with this dungeon.</span><br />I understand.  Look around more.  I made sure that warriors could go anywhere a mage can in that dungeon--and you'll probably find some places they missed while you're at it.<br /><br /> <img src="images/smilies/icon_exclaim.gif" alt=":!:" title="Exclamation" /><span style="font-weight: bold"> I think that the XP penalty should not apply when I fall down a crevice trying to leap onto our out of my guild geosid. Frankly I think that this is stupid to get a 5k penalty just because I am not a caster and can't trans my way onto or off of this plateau. I can leap, but even then it's cutting it WAY too close. I would suggest having a bridge of some sort or at least make the land a little bit more close for my leap to be safely on the other side each and every time.</span><br /><br />Not being able to trans is a limitation of being a warrior type.  Once trans wands become more available I suspect this won't be such an issue.  You already don't lose gear when falling down a pit--would you rather lose that than xp?  It's one or the other.  Otherwise, pits are pointless annoyances rather than dangerous map features.<br /><br /> <img src="images/smilies/icon_exclaim.gif" alt=":!:" title="Exclamation" /> <span style="font-weight: bold">I feel that I should not drop my equipment that I currently have equipped when dieing ... please look into reworking this system it would make the game A LOT more enjoyable.</span><br />Let me first say the way this system works:  you drop items based on your alignment.  If you don't pk, your alignment goes up and you will drop fewer items if you die.  Eventually you'll have a 70% chance of keeping all of your items when you die, and a 30% chance of dropping just one single item.  This hasn't been obvious so far since a player's alignment starts out so low for new characters and it takes a few days to increase.  I would like to keep the current system since it discourages mass PKing, and allows people to seek revenge on those who do (since the mass pkers will drop lots of items when they die, you're encouraged to hunt them!)<br /><br />Now, there is something else I have to address: currently, one or more of your items might disappear when you die.  I changed the way death drops work and didn't thoroughly test it, so there's a big issue with items disappearing.  This makes it look like you're dropping more items than you actually are!  I am fixing this right now, and it'll go up with the new update this morning.<br /><br />The other fix I will implement is to raise the default alignment of new players to a level where they will not drop many items on death.<br /><br /><br /><blockquote class="uncited"><div>That's about all the suggestions that I could think of I might have more later. Thank you for your time in reading this. This thread will keep being update throughout the beta.</div></blockquote><br />Thanks for providing your comments in the way you have.  Making them concise and grammatically correct is a good way to encourage me to read them.</div>

It's not difficult to obtain trans wands really, but it is if you're not the owner of that geosid and the people who do own it aren't really selling there trans wands on the bazaar.

			<div class="content"><img src="images/smilies/icon_idea.gif" alt=":idea:" title="Idea" /> While Warriors spells such as fury are overpowered, Hunter spells on the other hand are terrible, its becoming more and more difficult to level as I progress. Tornado only does 50% of weapon damage while the rest do around 10-20%, maybe you can look into buffing Tornado since it seems to be the only aoe that hunters rely on for leveling?</div>

Just because xen had exciting drops from players doesnt mean you should multiply this part to &quot;stand out&quot;, it doesnt mean the exciting part gets bigger, it was already brilliant as it was.<br /><br />who would corpse camp when you could steal some ones gear in like 2 kills?(corpse camp on xen was avoided by calling for friends and then it became a grand battle)<br /><br />Suggesting 1 random drop, or else downtime and whine will be uberhigh on forums.</div>

			<div class="content">EDIT- Deleted this post because it was a moot point.  Dev's aren't going to let Chaos players go without penalties.  I personally love this system, and have every intention of creating a chaos based player later in the developement.  If the guarantee of dropping 1 or 2 items every time you die rather than 1 item every 3 times you die is too much for you to handle, then you probably drive under 60 mph on a racetrack.</div>
