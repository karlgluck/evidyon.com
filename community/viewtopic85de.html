				<div class="content">I'm really curious on how this is going to work. Right now putting points (Into anything it seems) does nothing. When will this be implemented? How will this work? Will it be mostly a mystery? Meaning that Karl won't tell us how it works, will have to figure it out on our own?</div>

				<div class="content">the stat system isn't like xens current system, nor should it be.<br /><br />the effects of constitution are visible when you level up<br /><br />example<br /><br />go level a fig w/ 10 cons<br /><br />go level a fig with 23 cons (max beginning cons)<br /><br />you WILL find a difference</div>

				<div class="content">which would make sense, as starting off, Evidyon was supposed to be like Xenimus, and the original stat system for Xen made it so it actually made a difference on WHEN you put stat points in.</div>
