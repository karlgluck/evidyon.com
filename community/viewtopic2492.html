				<div class="content">His feedback was useless, since there is nothing better then the transportation method Xenimus already had..<br /><br />If other games had customized portal marks, they'd be much better; but most don't because it's allot to script and isn't always perfect (nothing ever is cause people suck)<br /><br />If I wanted to play a remake of WoW I'd do that, but this is intended to be a remake of Xenimus. Gtfo thnx<br /><br />If the project has been forfeited, then that's a different story.</div>

				<div class="content">This topic is going nowhere.  Although it raises some important questions, and questions that I (and we) will be thinking about, I think we've gotten a little too worked up about it.  I'm locking the topic so that we can move on and think about other things.  The discussion of portaling will be reopened when Karl gets back from his vacation and we've introduced the next big update, which will be a tricky one and will take a lot of work to get right--but I think once it's finished we might have a better perspective on this question.  Right now I'm leaning more toward the free-port system, but could of course be convinced otherwise.  So let's put this on hold.  I'm looking forward to addressing this question when we're better able to, both as a dev team and as a community.  In the meantime, let there be no hard feelings.<br /><br />Best,<br />Joe.</div>

				<div class="content">Hello everyone,<br /><br />I'm not technically &quot;back&quot; for another couple of days, but I read through this post and wanted to reassure all of you that nothing is set in stone.  We'll be discussing this (at length, I'm sure) at our next dev meeting and I hope to come back with something workable.<br /><br />-Karl</div>
