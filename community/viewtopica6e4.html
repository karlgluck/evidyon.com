				<div class="content">Thanks for your support!  We're really excited about this project.<br /><br />I'm rolling right into the last few days of class here, and next Monday kicks off Evidyon for this summer.  During the school year, I have trouble committing more than 10-15 hours / week on Evidyon because of classes--but you can see how far we've come in spite of that.  Stick with us while we revive old-school Xen, and then some!</div>
