				<div class="content">ok i didnt really wanna post it cause that's a very erasy way to crash server. and man i tried for atleast an hour last night to even get on that island with the high lvl stuff and it raped me before i would even hit the ground. <br /><br />P.S Karl things that are outside of your screen can still target you with there burn/beam/crazy blue and black things from the island. <br />and this is a different topic but is the spell eagle eye supposed to take mp? cause he's not actually doing anything except shooting the bow lol. but if u dont use eagle eye then it runs all the way up to them and shoots</div>

				<div class="content">To answer everyone's questions:<br /><br />- Geosids crashing the server should be fixed now (poked around last time the server crashed and figured out what y'all were up to!)<br />- The stuff on that island is level 25ish<br />- Definitely need to reduce the range on the casting monsters; will do that for the update I'm sending up this morning.<br />- Items will have props.  When?  That's a good question.  I'd like to get the game stable and with a regular player-base before adding them, though, because they're more of an &quot;advanced&quot; feature that I don't want to think about while we're still worried about tuning basic stuff like how much damage your average monster does and how much mp stuff costs.<br />- Eagleye makes it easy for hunters to use bows.  Instead of having to click on your enemies, you can just use Eagleye to shoot the bow in their direction.  Yes, it is supposed to cost a small amount of mp (although the damage is fuxed until I upload this morning's update)</div>
