				<div class="content">It was down.  I just restarted it.  Thanks for letting us know--this server has proved rather unreliable (there are many posts like this one littering the forums), and with Karl and I both rather busy with our studies at the moment, we don't always catch it right away when it goes down.  But as long as the physical hardware isn't down (which has happened a couple times, unfortunately), it just takes a couple seconds to restart once we're made aware of the situation.</div>
