				<div class="content">Hey everyone, I wanted to give you a sneak-preview of the new map engine I'm writing.  In order to make adding new content as smooth as possible going into beta, we need a map tool that can do everything we'll want to do in the future--so I've been working on a much better engine.  It has also been designed to help solve what I think is the cause of the BSOD bug.<br /><br />Anyway, here's a quickie map showing some of the features:<br /><img src="http://i43.tinypic.com/erbxax.png" alt="Image" /><br /><br />1. Invisible areas (insides of dungeons &amp; stuff)<br />2. Occluded areas--on the bottom/left side you can see how areas where monsters could be lurking are slightly darkened<br />3. Pits<br /><br />More to come!</div>

				<div class="content">i dont rly like the squared look it makes mistakes in certain spots, isnt there anyway to make the brush or whatever circular so that the game doesnt look all squared? make water/ground/pit/mountains by circular and things that should be squared could be created by a squared brush? <br /><br />this will make the game look more real, and less shabby, and people wont see the mistakes as easy.</div>

				<div class="content">Perhaps I should preface my post--I coded this in about 6 hours yesterday and the squareishness is just due to that this is a **test** of the new map engine.  In fact, this editor in its current form is already *more* capable of doing interesting, smooth features than the current map engine.  I just haven't made any yet.  Well, serves me right for showing a work-in-progress.</div>

				<div class="content">Wow Marz, I think you seem to have no clue how coding programming or anything like this works. (quite obviously) You are very abrupt.<br /><br />Anyway Karl, its looking nice that gives you the flexibility to create kind of like a cliff effect with water at the bottom of the cliff and things <img src="./images/smilies/icon_biggrin.gif" alt=":D" title="Very Happy" /> and pits too <img src="./images/smilies/icon_biggrin.gif" alt=":D" title="Very Happy" /><br /><br />Are we thinking of Invisible monsters in the shadows till they enter the light? :O ! how cool!</div>

				<div class="content">Yes, like Xenimus monsters that are behind walls (&quot;occluding objects&quot;) can't be seen until they come out of occlusion.  However, unlike Xen, Evidyon will feature a shadowed region to show you where exactly things could be hiding.  This is to solve a peculiar problem with overhead cameras: as a player you can see into a room, but your character can't.  This way you can get a feel for an area before jumping in, but you won't know what's in it.  I think it's a nice balance.</div>
