			<div class="content">I think you need professions so players can feel how it is to really customize their character and chose what works for them, like jeet kune do.. <img src="images/smilies/icon_smile.gif" alt=":)" title="Smile" /><br />ideas for professions or hero classes which could be gained at lvl 20-25?<br /><br />Warrior hero classes <br />Barbarian: Barbarian would mainly be warrior but with even more physical attacks and very tempramental, using his strength and rage to win his battles.<br />his ferocity bar changes into a rage bar and he gets even more powerfull attacks similar to the warrior.<br /><br />paladin: Paladin is a warrior who has sought path of protection for others using mana etc for spells some spells can also cause harm. <br />His ferocity bar becomes a mana bar instead.<br /><br />Hunter hero classes<br /><br />Ranger, a hunter whom has chosen a bow as his companion being able to cause alot of widespread dmg, maybe being able to use xploding arrows later? and maybe get an animal as a pet.. f.ex you chose what suits you at a trainer?<br />Rogue, a class who puts use of agility equilibrium and swords/daggers above anything else, being able to sneak around undetected and cause incredible amounts of dmg in short time, maybe gets sword dance later? a series of high speed moves which causes high dmg within a area.(like poff you dont see the rogue all you see are like swift movements within an area and then every thing dies, unless players etc?)<br /><br />Sorcerer hero classes<br />Warlock: a Sorceror which has possibly gone mad and seeks the ways of pestilence and destruction all around him, being able to summon demons to aid him for short amounts of time.<br /><br /><br />Well thats all i came up with at this time, but im betting other people probably know about some classes etc.</div>

			<div class="content">Hmm depends on how you are trying to push this... now if you have to choose a certain profession then it would not be possible to make a hybrid.. i.e. Conquer Online- if you choose a class you have to stay that class and work your way up that and don't get to switch... Now if your thinking like a kind of skill tree to venture through i understand, but then you have to put thought into it.. but the aspect of xenimus was that you knew at a certain level that you would get that certain spell so you worked to get it.. and that always seemed fine to me<br /><br />Now with that end statement <blockquote class="uncited"><div>cool thing about this system though is that if people were to attack a player they would have 2 be ready to change tactics incase they actually thought the enemy was a wizard/warlock.</div></blockquote> you may disagree with me but xenimus has one of the best pvp systems. That's because you know what spell to expect and you know what you can do to counter it.. if you start throwing some crazy stuff in there then its going to be a lame pvp game because you have to switch your tactics all the time.. All characters should be balanced and not have to change tactics because of different spells. What are you going to have to run off to get different gear since the guy was a warlock instead of a wizard.. That's what makes some pvp games lame is because to fight a certain person you need certain gears on to fight them. If some guy in real life came at you with a flamethrower and you had a gun your not going to run off and get a flame resistant suit.. your going to shoot him in the face. No tactics, just use what you were given.</div>

TBH that statement sounds rediculous, im not saying that a player would have to change gear to &quot;warlock&quot; resistant gear to win a battle, he would just have to think differently, making the game easy to play but hard to master.<br /><br />when it comes to pvp, i helped karl alot out in beta when it came to it, he even added a spell with a idea i had, not to brag, but just to tell you that ive played tons of pvp based games not only mainstream games either and i can really compare the pvp aspects of each game, and for me XEN was the best pvp game ever, but it was because of the 0 cast time &amp; skills required.</div>

That's because you know what spell to expect and you know what you can do to counter it.</div></blockquote><br /><br />This is *exactly* what a professional game designer wrote in an article I read for Game Developer magazine.  Here is a paraphrase:<br /><br /><blockquote><div><cite>Damion Schubert wrote:</cite>Case Study:  Classes in MMOs<br />One of the classic debates is whether MMOs should have rigid classes.  ... If you run across a Witch Elf [in Warhammer: Age of Reckoning], the strategy and tactics you employ are going to be very different than if you stumble across a Sorceress.  If you couldn't tell a Witch Elf from a Sorceress, strategy would become <span style="font-weight: bold">impossible</span> ... In a pure classless system, strategy disappears.  You know nothing about the capabilities of your opponent, ... and most players  will devolve their tactics into a single abilities rotation that works the majority of the time.</div></blockquote><br /><br />The full article made me realize that not only do classes need to be distinctive in how their spells look and how their abilities play, EJ also did something perfect with the items system: developing level-based sets.  When you see someone in lightning leather, you know they're between level 12 and 18.  Mystic = 18-30 if they're poor, Spirit at 26 (or whatever it is now) if they're rich.  Similarly, someone with blue egg is at least level 40.  This stratification and immediate identifiability is what makes strategy and competition possible and fun!</div>
