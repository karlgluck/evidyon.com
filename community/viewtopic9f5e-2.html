				<div class="content">I just got the blue screen of death, and im pretty sure my theory as to why it happened was right. If the debug files don't close properly when the game tries to open them it creates a &quot;serious error&quot; according to windows, and windows(xp) creates the screen to protect your computer from the error(or atleast thats what my BSOD said). Im now trying to figure out how to get rid of the error. Deleting the debug files didn't help apparently...<br /><br />What happened to me:<br />I opened 2 evidyons accidently and alt+f4'ed one of em closed, but the log was created for it already. The log didn't close properly and so the other one BSOD'd me as soon as i logged into my character.<br /><br />EDIT: Actually, now that i think of it, it's definitely not the debug files fault, as they are recreated every time you open the program, but rather the .GME file =/. Makes more sense too considering every instance of Evidyon has to open the same .GME file and closing it improperly could cause evil errors...<br /><br />More information:<br />The problem only happens to NVidia graphic cards(I'm pretty sure you already know that), or at least it should only happen to them.<br />It either fixes itself or is fixed with a new update(better yet, a recompiling, since mem addresses get changed), im not sure which one, but I guess we'll find out tommorow. This isn't the first time I had it and it went away on its own, but i'm not quite sure when...<br /><br />All in all, for all NVidia users, to avoid the problem just make sure you close Evidyon properly. Even if you click the X in the corner, its still proper. Alt+f4'ing on the other hand, and ending the process via task manager, doesn't send in the close message to the window, giving it no chance to properly close the file.(This is all still my theory...)<br /><br />Would anyone who had the BSOD tell me what you did before you got it please? and when it went away? I wanna see if im right <img src="images/smilies/icon_smile.gif" alt=":)" title="Smile" />, and help solve it, of course.</div>

				<div class="content">are you talking about the n4_disp.dll loop?<br /><br />If so then my error has occurred whilst walking around sometimes the suddenly the computer made a BSOD for some strange reason.<br /><br />Since running it in window mode on a high resolution so that It covers my scree, I havent had a BSOD using window mode. It was happening during fullscreen, My fix was to log onto the character who BSOD's everytime you log in, and get onto that character via another PC walk away from the spot i was at, then come back on the original PC and it would work.<br /><br />I don't know how that happens or what was going on before, but it was usually after killing a monster i believe...It seemed fairly random to me,<br /><br />Like I said Karl if I get the error again I will wait for you to log onto that character using something to trace what is going on maybe? at some point, thats if I get the problem again lol!</div>

				<div class="content">hmmm ok strange... but yeah for me the fix might have just been walking away the first time, but this time it isn't. I wanna see if it'll stop with the update =/ if not then o well i still have a shitty compy i can play this game on. I'll do more research on the error.<br /><br />And yeah it was nv4_disp.dll</div>
