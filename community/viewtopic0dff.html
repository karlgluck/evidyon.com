				<div class="date"><img src="styles/prosilver/imageset/icon_post_target.gif" width="11" height="9" alt="Post" title="Post" />Posted: <strong>Sun Sep 21, 2008 2:15 pm</strong></div>

				<div class="content">A lot of what is in the game right now has not been well thought-out.  It was mostly implemented just for testing purposes, and wasn't ever intended to become permanent.  <span style="font-style: italic">(aside: For a perfect description of why this stuff has hung around so long, see <a href="http://www.1729.com/blog/EconomicsOfTestingUglyCode.html" class="postlink">http://www.1729.com/blog/EconomicsOfTestingUglyCode.html</a></span>)<br /><br />I am still hoping to release 1.09 today, but I'm spilling some of the more major changes into 1.10 (in about 2 weeks) and 1.11 (3 weeks or so) so that I can give you fair warning:<br /><br /><span style="font-weight: bold"><span style="font-size: 200%; line-height: 116%;">Update 1.11 will wipe all characters and items from the game.</span></span><br /><br />There are too many races and classes right now for me to effectively manage them all and make all of them (1) progress naturally and (2) do so in a fun way.  I will be trimming down in 1.11 to the following *basic* classes (these aren't the names, they're just the descriptions)<br /><br />- Tough melee (warrior)<br />- Fast melee (theif)<br />- Offensive mage (wizard)<br />- Defensive mage<br /><br />At this time, new hunting areas a swath of new items, more monsters and spells, and other content stuff will be introduced.  There will be basically no feature-coding between 1.10 and 1.11; it is an entirely content-based update to see how far I can get with my current game engine engine.<br /><br />That said, I'd like to reward people who have been active in alpha and would welcome suggestions on how <img src="images/smilies/icon_smile.gif" alt=":)" title="Smile" /></div>

				<div class="content">Sounds neat-o. A bit simplification considering classes is a good idea, will be handy especially when it comes to updating them.<br />Defensive mage sounds like a cleric to me eh?<br /><br />As for rewards, how about some xp/level-boost or a newbgear-set? That would be an actually useful reward hehe. :J</div>

				<div class="content">Yay, no more adepts. I am looking forward to some more developed and balanced characters. <br /><br />A decent weapon, a different one for each class, to help kick start leveling as a reward would be an idea.</div>

				<div class="content">I think that's a good idea to simplify classes that way for now. Makes it easier for you and us to test out spells and melee abilities and to figure out where to implement them class-wise later on.<br /><br />As for the alpha tester rewards...maybe one bonus stat point or something on a character? I dunno...it doesn't matter much to me anyways. The game is fun to play and test with as it is!</div>

				<div class="content"><span style="font-size: 93%; line-height: 116%;">personally I don't think we should receive any rewards for this Karl, obviously this takes up as much of your time as it does ours, and you have no real &quot;Reward&quot; as such. We ultimately do this by choice not by dictation or false communication.<br /><br />I do think that the majority of characters that had been leveled were mage classes with all the spells, and so to equally distribute a reward for an adept over people who have of equal level a melee class, would be definitely hard to determine in terms of &quot;fairness&quot;.<br /><br />If we all have to start again and no rewards, that is entirely cool, but then am I just playing devils advocate??. I don't think so, I believe that what we do for you is out of kind heart, not for self centered and reward based terms. I do understand your reasoning for this as everyone would like different things, but in my own opinion I would gladly level from the start with a melee class once again, without any form of reward.<br /><br />It has all been out of the kindness of our hearts, and loyalty, nothing more. <img src="images/smilies/icon_smile.gif" alt=":)" title="Smile" /><br /><br /><br />All the Very Best,<br />Richard</span></div>

				<div class="content">Yeah, I am doing it because I actually like the game...  It has potential.  I think that's why I liked xenimus so much -- because it had so much potential I thought.  It was so vastly different from other games out there.  But with Xenimus, it became stagnant.  I suppose the potential is still there, you just have a lazy guy in charge.  <br /><br />Here you have multiple people with fresh ideas, feedback from the creators, and great input from the &quot;testers&quot; as you call us.  I think there is some great potential here.<br /><br />As far as the rewards and losing characters go... sucks that we lose everything, characters included.  But it is fair.  For rewards, it could be something so simple as to have each beta player have some &quot;beta emblem&quot; by their name when it's displayed.  Or even give some of the most helpful the option of naming some monsters (to a certain extent.... we don't want a giant skeleton named 'Boo-Boo Kitty-####').  <br /><br />As for my reward?  I demand you accept my help when I draw up models for you!!! <img src="images/smilies/icon_wink.gif" alt=";)" title="Wink" />  <br /><br />Good going guys.</div>

				<div class="content">upon pondering today at work i have to change sides lol, and agree with exot, we dont play evidyon hoping for a reward when we go live, we play it because we see it has great potential and want to be able to say &quot;hey i was here when it all began&quot; and do our best in helping the game flourish<br /><br /><br />Your Caring Bug Hunter<br /><br />-Matt</div>

				<div class="content">sounds good to me. this is an excellent idea,it is like when xenimus first came out all you had<br />was a fighter,warlock,and two other classe.it has been so long that i can't remember the other two.<br />but that is the problem with so many games today,when you log on there are like<br />10 t0 15 different types of characters you can make.I think when you<br />have more then 5 choices then it is hard to actually find and make a<br />good balanced character so you just keep up the good work.<br />O yea about the reward thingy,our reward is being able to play this game<br />and having you answer all of our questions,listen to all of our suggestions<br />and not being as a++ like someone else of another game that we all know about.<br />so i think that ever time that we log on to the game and are able to test it out<br />with all the new things that you are doing that that is our reward.<br />any how keep up the good work.</div>

				<div class="content">how about an alpha ring one that is stuck on that specific char so that when or if that partictualr char ends up still on this game in the long run they have something to show they were here unlike just saying u were baddass in beta.<br /><br />Probably would have to say keep it to each class maybe a stat bonus or something what ever is most important to the game at the moment and let it evolve as well as the game <img src="images/smilies/icon_smile.gif" alt=":)" title="Smile" /> have a good one</div>
