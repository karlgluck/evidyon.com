				<div class="content">Stopped by to see whats up and boy what a surprise!<br /><br />Great progress Karl and everyone else contributing! The spell video was nifty. I'm glad to see you're still pursuing this project, I know how much it'll mean to you when it's complete. I noticed the spells and combat aren't Xenimus clones, it'll be interesting to see what your take on this game will be (we had some SICK ideas for BtR). Anyway hope NY and college are treatin' ya well my friend. Did I tell you I was planning on moving out to NYC after I complete my bachelors? Just finished up my 2 year and I'm starting my major in marketing, so if you ever need any help in that field you know where to look!</div>

				<div class="content">Hey kuba,<br /><br />Nice to see more and more people jumping around making posts <img src="images/smilies/icon_smile.gif" alt=":)" title="Smile" />, it has to be said that the progress being made is that of sheer quality. As you can imagine this will not be a direct lift of Ej's Xenimus, but in fact a complete new and very much improved systems which are going to impress all original gamers of Xenimus, and hopefully together we can mould the game into a more friendly and interesting community.<br /><br />I'm hoping the community doesn't turn into Xentales2...I'm almost certain it won't, but you can be assured some people from those locations will be joining volucris to check out the absolute genius production, but hopefully will not bring such unimportant attitudes to the gameplay. Not that you cant stop it but...It would be great if it didn't go that way <img src="images/smilies/icon_smile.gif" alt=":)" title="Smile" />, But known Karl, I have full confidence that things will not go down that route so easily <img src="images/smilies/icon_smile.gif" alt=":)" title="Smile" />.<br /><br /><br />All the Best.<br /><br />Richard</div>

				<div class="content">Hey Kuba!  Great to hear from you--it's been a while <img src="images/smilies/icon_biggrin.gif" alt=":D" title="Very Happy" />  I'm glad you are going into marketing--that sounds like a lot of fun; have a good time in NYC!  Be sure to come back here and visit--especially in August.</div>
