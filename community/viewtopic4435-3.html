				<div class="content">I figure this doesn't need or have to be added anytime soon, but I was thinking about an ingame music player. Been awhile, but I used to play this game called 2Moons that had one in it, and it was a pretty nifty feature. The bright side of it was to choose what song you want a lot faster instead of having to window out and do so. <br /><br />I recall you took the songs you wanted to listen to and placed them in a music folder inside of the installation folder, thus adding them to the game. There was a few problems with theirs that maybe fixable such as, You couldn't make folders to put the music in so that they would be organized by band name, or even album names. This meaning it would put ripped albums in messed up order as the songs would be titled &quot;02 - Master of Puppets(, or whatever the title of the song is)&quot; for example.<br /><br />Just figured I would throw this out there. Just a neat little idea I thought maybe fun and some use to the game. <img src="images/smilies/icon_smile.gif" alt=":)" title="Smile" /></div>

My bad entirely!<br /><br />That could work, but not really worth it. If people wanted an ingame messenger you should try applying for Xfire and getting your game sponsored by them. We tried with Xenimus, but EJ wouldn't put forth any effort so it never happened there. At least you're one who will try your best to get it done. <img src="images/smilies/icon_smile.gif" alt=":)" title="Smile" /></div>
