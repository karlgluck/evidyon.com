				<div class="content">Hey Everyone,
<br />
<br />For any semi-new people here, SilverT and I have done most of the music / sounds so far, but haven't been around for the past couple of months.  I don't know what SilverT's plans are, but I'm back and am ready to start cranking stuff out.  (plus I switched my major from engineering to music, so I've learned some new tricks).
<br />
<br />Anyway, I was reading Links post in the audio forum about how a good game has music which matches its dungeons.  While a separate theme for every hunting area in an MMO isn't practical,  I think it is definitely a good idea to capture the general feel of the game in the music.  
<br />
<br />So here is my proposition to mapmakers:
<br />
<br />You tell me what defining aspects or themes your map/dungeon has, what a journey through it would be like, etc., and what you imagine the music being like for that area.... then I'll try and compose it!  In addition to making the game a whole lot cooler, this will make my job a lot easier since I'll have a more clearly defined idea of what I'm going for.
<br />
<br />Let me know what you think,
<br />
<br />Zach</div>
