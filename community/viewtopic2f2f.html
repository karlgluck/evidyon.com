				<div class="content">We've moved over to a new server with lots of bandwidth.  Hopefully there won't be any issues with it--the biggest problem we had on our old one was the bots.
<br />
<br />Unfortunately, we weren't able to keep user names or the old posts when we moved.  But hey, now we have a clean slate on which to draw.  Here are my recent sketches:
<br />
<br />The Born to Rule client has a really good feel to it.  It's pretty slow on older machines, though--I'll definitely have to fix this.  After all, if people can't play then there's not much point in having a game.  I really like the way that it is coded, however, so there are probably some optimizations I need to do that don't have to do with its coding, but more with its design.  Hopefully there won't be too many problems with this.
<br />
<br />In the light of our new design model, I'm changing the way the program works a little bit.  One thing I recently came up with is called UnseenDT (or Unseen Data Template) that allows anyone to easily design and create data structures.  Whoop-de-doo, data, why does that matter?  Because maps are just data structures.  UnseenDT is very flexible and reasonably intuitive.  I think it'd be cool to release a &quot;mapping&quot; version of BtR without content, but with an UnseenDT reader so you guys can make some maps (by typing stuff into a file, for now) and fly around in them.
<br />
<br />For now, however, I just have these screenshots from the client to show.  Please ignore the ugly and obtrusive chat window.  <img src="images/smilies/icon_wink.gif" alt=":wink:" title="Wink" />

<br />
<br />In terms of that mapping idea, that'd be really awesome. I don't really know of too many games that allow for that, except perhaps BF1942 that allows you to modify maps server-side as long as you don't use custom objects.
<br />
<br />I really really really <span style="font-style: italic">really <span style="font-weight: bold">really</span></span> can't wait to get my hands on this game!  <img src="images/smilies/icon_biggrin.gif" alt=":D" title="Very Happy" /></div>
