				<div class="content">Yep.  I think this might have to do with the town guard stepping on a portal:  that's been mentioned a couple times in connection with crashes, and tonight there were some folks porting around who hit the guard a couple times.<br /><br />It might also be a party command.  I think I had just typed a p/ command when the server crashed.</div>

				<div class="content">Karl will be informed about the guards.<br />Marzuku and I were experimenting this afternoon to see if we could crash the server by porting a guard, we didnt suceed.<br />But, we did find out that the guards do the same thing the bat/dragon geoside guard does.<br />When Marzuku went through town as an evil character and I was behind a little bit recording, Marzuku went faster than the guards and when Marzuku couldn't bee seen the guards turned and started attacking me.  Pretty funny.  But good to know that is one less thing to worry about once I tell Karl.</div>

It happened exactly when I ported a now evil player to the ancient lands as a guard was chasing him. When he went in, <span style="text-decoration: underline"><span style="font-weight: bold">the guard flipped out and started speeding around the square</span></span>, and then the server crashed. BTW, that play (forgot name) got killed many times, because he kept spawning at square. It was really unfair to him, he probably has a huge penalty and lost all his gear  <img src="images/smilies/icon_sad.gif" alt=":(" title="Sad" /> .<br /><br />Edit for clarity: I think when the guard tried to attack him in a totally isolated land, he bugged.</div></blockquote><br />Someone the guard was chasing ported to acient lands (which is totally isolated), and the guard was still trying to attack him from the nexus area.</div>

				<div class="content">Marzuku was at my place when he tried to crash the server, the guards attacked him since hes evil but once he ported out the guards started randombly attacking the other guys standing still at square.. And the name of the guard turned a bit grey aswell, like it lost alignment.</div>
