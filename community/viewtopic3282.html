<br />If you level that high you deserve good spells.

				<div class="content">yeah. high levels did get good spells. they got cross beam and cross bomb and some other good ones. no need to make them overpowered. 3 star invis is a perk of the thief class. not every high level mage in the game.</div>

<br />
<br />Spin was added in 2001.  It is now 2007.  I can't see how calling an event in the first seventh of Xen's lifetime very new is justified.  I have no problem with you trying to make that guy look like a complete newb, but at least do it right.  Maybe some personal bashing?  Or at least a reference to his mother's snatch.
<br />
<br />And about the level 12 spin: 
<br />
<br />I'm against it because it would make even more hunting areas obsolete.  Personally, I loved spin when it was 25 for paladins.  It gave me motivation to level.  If I had it at 12, sure I could gain xp three times as fast, but what would be the point?</div>
