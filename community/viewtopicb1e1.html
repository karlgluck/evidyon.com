				<div class="content">Another Possible Bug with Geosids:  I don't know if it was intended to be this way, but when I hover over stackable items such as for example a Red Potion, it says I can sacrifice it for 1 geonite.  But when I drop a stack of 50 Red Potions, they are not sacrificed for 50 geonites, they are still sacrificed for 1 geonite.  I think this is a bug because you can split the 50 potions into 1's and sacrifice all of them singly for a total of 50 geonites.</div>
