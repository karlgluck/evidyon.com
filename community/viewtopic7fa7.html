				<div class="content">I'm sorry that I missed the Alpha Testing, first of all, I messaged Karl ages ago about it and then never came back.  So far, I think that you have far more of a right to charge for this game than EJ does for his.<br /><br />Things I noticed while playing.<br /><br />When entering the dungeon in T1 Hell Hound's (South Dungeon?) I sometimes port right back out. I suspect that it ports me too close to the exit portal.<br /><br />Robur apparently has no effect or SFX.<br /><br />When I level up from 12 to 13 I lost a huge amount of power in my Nex Noctum.  It went from registering a 66.0 to registering a 48.0 on the skeleton.<br /><br />Readme states &quot;For global chat, prefix - to your message (e.g., --is anybody on?).&quot; it should state &quot;For global chat, prefix &gt; to your message (e.g., &gt;is anybody on?).<br /><br />Readme mentions a Geoling.  I haven't seen one in T1.<br /><br />There is also no mention of what qualifies you to be an owner of Geosids, thus I wouldn't know how to join guild.  (I don't know if this is intentional or not, it just seems that Geosids are an important part of this game.)<br /><br />Readme could include /monsters and /all in PVP section<br /><br />F1 could include the entire and updated contents of the Readme file rather just the list of guild commands (which could also be in the Readme)<br /><br />I hope this helps, and thank you for making this game!!!</div>

				<div class="content">Oh and I forgot to mention, it seems like items stay on the ground a very long time and then dissapear all at once no matter when they were dropped.  I dunno if this was just the way it looked to me with all the hunting that was going on, but I figured when Evidyon has a lot of players, that could lag the system quite a bit.</div>
