				<div class="content">Karl, I was wondering if you could maybe make the Evidyon directory a little more organized. There is no reason that all the debug files, key files, data files, etc. should all be in the same exact directory as the actual .exe rather then in their own sub-directory, and they just clutter things up more then is necessary(especially the debug files). This has always been one thing that I really disliked about Xenimus.<br /><br />Also, I was wondering if it would be a hassle to include the d3dx9_39.dll(I think that's the only one people are missing usually) with Evidyon so that when Evidyon installs the dll is in the folder automatically, meaning that we do not have to do any additional installing, and our system32 folder remains untouched <img src="images/smilies/icon_smile.gif" alt=":)" title="Smile" />. It would also help people new to the game in that they don't have to go through the trouble of finding the help on this forum.<br /><br />Edit: the file is only about 3.67MB so it wouldn't drastically increase the size of Evidyon or anything</div>

				<div class="content">This is getting crazy.  Every time I make a change for the next update, you come along and make a post about it.  First it was the new movement system, now the directory formatting.  Stop ruining my surprises! <img src="images/smilies/icon_razz.gif" alt=":P" title="Razz" /> lol<br /><br />Actually, I hadn't previously released the d3dx9 DLL with the game because Microsoft said specifically not to...it breaks compatibility with future version bug fixes and what-not.  However, I suppose putting it in the directory itself instead of installing it as a system-level DLL could work--the biggest potential problems I could see would be incompatibility with the currently-installed version of the core d3d9.dll and the increased download time.</div>

				<div class="content">Can you include the windows directx updater from the windows site? If so just have that run if that error is thrown. I guess that would work and be easy for people to understand, just having a popup to update directx....</div>

				<div class="content">Well what I'm thinking is, if the .dll is in the directory, then that's probably where Evidyon first checks for the dll(i'm not too sure about this one... maybe it checks path first). Even if there is a compatability issue, eventually, it can be solved just by deleting the .dll in the folder, and that problem is far less likely then the &quot;cannot find d3dx9_39.dll&quot; one anyway, thus worth doing. Idunno, though, just something to consider.</div>
