				<div class="content">I coded everything for the sound effects this morning, so they're now in the game and ready to use!  The support includes N-buffering (you can have up N number of simultaneous sounds playing at the same time), sound cache, so sounds are stored in memory for fast access, and support for changing volume, frequency and the left/right pan of a sound.
<br />
<br />I fully intend to use this to its largest effect: effects to the left of the player will be played more on the left-speaker according to how far along the screen they are.  Also, effects further away from the player will be a bit softer than those right next to him or her.
<br />
<br />Thadius, would you mind setting up a sound effects area on PV.com which can do something similar to the gallery (I.E. someone uploads a sound and it appears in a gallery which can be played online)?  My brother Erich made a BUNCH of sound effects a while ago and I'd like to share them with you guys.  They're actually quite good!</div>

				<div class="content">Yeah Karl, great job on the sounds.
<br />
<br />As for the gallery of sounds, I'll see what I can do for that, but for now we can just use the directory listing and/or browse it using the file uploader interface.</div>
