				<div class="content">Okay idk if these are gonna show up on the update, or not..<br /><br />Okay first, for the people who run multiple monitors on 1 computer, the mouse seems to be able to go off the game.. which in some cases is a good thing, but when the game gets further in and we're into fast PVP like in most-cases, the last thing we dual monitor people need is to click off screen, causing = of course Death.<br /><br />And also looking for a windowed mode, this in some cases would really help since all games that I run on full screen crashes constantly, but puting them in windowed mode fix's this. I haven't yet crashed in Volucris, but none-the-less, its simply an idea.  (Of course this kinda defeats the purpose of my first idea lol)</div>

				<div class="content">1) This is something Karl should add eventually. He needs to stick the actual mouse cursor into the center of the screen and have the in-game cursor move by the offset amount... Although I wouldn't say this is anywhere near top priority.. lol. It would be useful as when I play in windowed mode I always accidently click off screen.<br /><br />2) Windowed mode does exist. Config.ini has a flag &quot;fullscreen=X&quot; and when set to 0, it's in windowed mode, when set to 1, it's fullscreen.</div>

I know, thats why I said when the game gets faster, it would help.. now currently.. lol since it doesn't matter a whole lot<br /><br />and I rly had no idea about the full screen.. Maybe a settings option in game to change full screen/windowed..?</div>

				<div class="content">1.  Yes!  I agree.  However, there is a problem implementing it which is why I haven't done so yet:  what about when you WANT to get your mouse out of the window?  If it's locked inside, that kinda defeats the purpose of windowed mode.<br /><br />2.  Settings dialog is on my list.  Bug me about this though because it's something I keep forgetting to do/putting off.</div>

When you have a menu open, of any kind(stats screen, inventory, etc etc) the cursor is no longer locked to the center of the screen and can be moved off to resize the window, select other windows, etc etc. It's really useful like that in that while actually playing the game the cursor is locked and you can't accidentally unfocus Evidyon, but while in stats screen(i.e. not fighting,) you can do all that you need to do.</div>
