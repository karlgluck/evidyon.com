				<div class="content">Game is up and running, i am trying the game out myself it's addictive and atm is under progress.<br /><br />Though it is in Alpha phase you can still try out the game by asking Joe.M or Karl, they've set up a &quot;Who want to play?&quot; post which you write <br />F.ex &quot;Can i join the testers so Mm4 can pk me and steal all my gear and then make posts about it on forums?&quot;<br />Something like that!<br /><br />Then Karl or Joe will most likely surf through the post and see you and add you to the alpha tester squad and you can manually download the game. <img src="images/smilies/icon_twisted.gif" alt=":twisted:" title="Twisted Evil" /></div>

				<div class="content">Beta should have been released along time ago. People don't give a poo if it's not complete. Just look at xen. <br /><br />It's called a work in progress for a reason. It seems they've gotten comfortable with the current system. I think it's time to stop fucking around and get that poo out on the market so they can start making back the money they spunked making the damn thing.<br /><br />And to speed up the process of Xenimus's demise, of course.</div>

				<div class="content">yeah i agree with axel, people expand games while they are being played and Evidyon certainly can afford a crowd of players atm, but the servers wont agree completly with the crowd though axel, and Karl will whip out his wallet if the crowd becomes to big for the server to handle, which is why i sent out about 100-150 mails yesterday to Envolve people who are interested in the alpha, every one is invited to join, myself a lvl 14 Sorcerer owning the most badass monsters ingame, though they tend to 2-3 hit me and respawn icredibly quikly, me and Solomon(joe.M) lost gear equivalent to spirit and vt's just grinding.<br />Biohazard made a char, Hydraulic is lvling, Zombies(some wierdo) Mm4(Mm3),Solomon, Sparkles!, Grammar nazi, The macgyver will be joining once i show him the new game and Geezmo might try it.<br /><br />Game is completly playable i find it addictive and pk'ing atm works perfect cause atm there is no such item as a &quot;Magic bag&quot; and some of us are wearing pretty handsome items if i might say.<br /><br />Trans, Greenbombin(putesco),ignis, Ignis multi, frigilum ignis(Frostbolt), Whirlwind(spin) and more to be added!<br /><br />You have the chance to play it while its fresh and watch it be upgraded as you lvl, all i can say is apply for alpha check out the screenshots and enjoy.<br /><br />Mm4 over and out.</div>

Beta will be released in just a few weeks, as soon as we have most of the basic capabilities in place.  For example, we don't have a quest system right now, but we're probably going to have the capability implemented before Beta, even if there's only one lame &quot;go kill 10 crawlers&quot; quest.  That way, we can focus on adding content and ironing out bugs during Beta instead of trying to implement whole new systems.<br /><br />Then, after there's enough content, we'll get the commercial release.<br /><br />I understand your impatience, and believe me--we're impatient too!  Karl has been working on some version of this game for quite some time now, and finally he's got a viable game.  But we can't rush things *too* much.</div>
