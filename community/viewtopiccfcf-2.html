				<div class="content">Boss fights in xenimus have always seemed kinda dumb. They are not nearly epic enough.
<br />I had a dream one time about an awesome boss fight system. ITs a little far fetched but bear with me. 
<br />You and your buddies enter a boss zone and the area becomes an &quot;arena&quot; Music plays. I mean like rock music or something. A bar appears and you have to keep the bar above 50%. The bars progress is commanded my damage dealt per minute to the boss. If atleast one person is alive and the bar is over 50% when the song ends, you win. Otherwise the boss escapes somehow. OR maybe he kills everyone in your party? Anyway, to see a mage boss firing all sorts of cool looking magic everywhere in sync with some high-energy music would be an awesome gameplay experience, thats why I posted in here. 
<br />I know this is unlikely but I think its a cool idea and I wanted to get it out there. If there is any one thing that Xenimus got right it was the visual presentation of magic. Its just cool. If you've ever seen two high level mages PvP you know what I mean. Too see that kind of light show orchestrated to Dark Moor or Dragonforce would just be badass. Also, because the fights last a few minutes it encourages teamplay, i.e. using a cleric rather than burning 500 maxies. 
<br />What ya think? It could be real trippy. The final boss fight could be played with Tool's &quot;Triad&quot; playing. hahahah!</div>
