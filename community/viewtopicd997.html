				<div class="content">Your game system is all wrong, been looking up xen pictures, threads and facts to make a post that you will have to read to get the game on the right track.<br /><br />Properties problem: <br />lets stick to basic properties no special properties unless you find equivalent of diabolic,spirit or omni, dirus(lets just say RARE items)<br /><br />you get a armor/weapon it has 30 defence or 80 dmg PERIOD!(numbers are just examples)<br />unless youve got a special item that gives you an extra mp/hp reg /reditus /almus /speed then you've got to prop that item to gain something. <br />No fucking random 200% running speed and 3000% attack speed, items could appear with as much as 3 props like on xen(i think) but the rest is up to you and farming prop items like opals, ring, emeralds.<br /><br />there was special properties for each item you had, helmet, armor, weapon, gloves, shield we should have boots aswell:D(just an idea)<br />Follow THESE instructions of properties.(or change what you want but the maximum of 7 properties)<br /><br />Armors<br />1 hp reg(you could get 2 hp reg counted as 2 props)<br />1 mp reg(you could get 2 mp reg counted as 2 props)<br />7% reflective(stupid property, but means 7% of the damage would go back to the enemy)<br />5 protection(you could get 10 protection counts like 2 props)<br /><br />Helmets<br />1 hp reg(you could get 2 hp reg counted as 2 props)<br />1 mp reg(you could get 2 mp reg counted as 2 props)<br />Night vision(let you see in the dark, we should have day and night)<br />8% base hp<br />8% base mp<br /><br />Gloves<br />2 skill, meaning skill of weapon, we dont have weapon skill in evidyon.<br />5%rage (like some nice damage boost for each %)<br />5% attack speed(could be propped to 10% meaning 2 props)<br />10% lethal attack<br />10% ferocious attack <br /><br />Weapons<br />8% steal hp<br />8% steal mp<br />20% stupify enemy(slow him down a little)<br />10% attack speed<br />10% ferocious hit<br />10% rage<br />1 skill point.<br /><br />Shields<br />+6 armor<br />7% reflective<br />1 defence<br />resist poison<br />resist stupify<br />resist dispell<br /><br /><br />Stat problem:<br />Stats should be set up with intelligence IQ and some thinking, not like a neanderthal with everything on strength that would ruin the purpouse of the game being hardcore and set us at a world of warcraft level(retard proof).<br /><br />This game should be about skills in battle and how you set up your character with stats and how fast you are to spam attacks and heals.<br /><br />Stats and attributes of a character get boosted by properties whom give f. ex 8% base health, meaning the more you put on cons the more you will benifit from this property same with all other stats.<br /><br />A good suggestion to stats(making every one wanting to stat smart):<br /><br />heres an idea, every one starts out with the same stats at level 1(depending on class of course).<br />the primary stats dont have alot to say cause you are a newb just starting and you need training/leveling so with the primary stats you would attack quite slow, and hit decent and have low health, if you were to say put all your stats on strength until level 25 and have 42 strength, you would be powerfull indeed but you would lack health and you're attack would be so slow that people could easily beat you in a duel cause you lack speed and health.<br /><br /><br />Stats what they should do:<br /><br />Strength:<br />Strength just becomes more attack power for each point.<br /><br />Agility:<br />Agility speeds up your attacks if you are a ranger, if you are a knight you dont get anything unless you have 29 agilty which gives you faster melee and fast spin/vortex/whirlwind which made it easier to level.<br />(xen had this cap and a good melee player would have 29 agility)<br /><br />Our casters should also have usage of agility so maybe at a 29 agility casters gained fast beam.<br />There should not exist one item that gave a player noticable faster attacks than 29 agility, or else you could just delete agility ingame.<br /><br />Constitution:<br />Constitution just gave a player more health and he would get more if he had alot of cons and base hp prop<br /><br />Intelligence:<br />Intelligence gave a player attack power, but only if he was a caster.<br /><br />Intelligence/wisdom was attackpower and mana but for some casters it would differ which gave you dmg and mana.<br /><br />Wisdom:<br />Wisdom just gave a player more mana, no magic defence cause that would then nullify items that had magic defence.<br /><br />Items on xen were very different, no two weapons had same damage, this was important so that people actually could be unique, same as for people having rare weapons.<br /><br />Anything to add? if i remember anything i will add it aswell, but atm i have grasped the very content of what xen had.<br /><br />Mm4/Carnage out.</div>

				<div class="content">Ok, take a deep breath.  Now let it out.  One more. Good.  Relaxed?<br /><br />#1:  This is alpha.<br />#2:  The items were never &quot;designed&quot; in any sense of the word.  They were tossed in to test ideas and, (is this the 50th time I've told you now?), are going to be completely replaced.<br />#3:  This is alpha.<br />#4:  The game isn't finished.  The design isn't finished.  Nothing is set in stone.  Evidyon will resurrect the style of old Xenimus--but we have to poke around and *find* that style first, which involves a lot of experimentation.<br />#5:  Did I mention this is <span style="font-weight: bold">alpha</span>?<br /><br /><blockquote><div><cite>marzuku wrote:</cite>this game can be everything xen was and more.</div></blockquote><br /><br />Thanks, I appreciate that.</div>

				<div class="content">That's a very <span style="font-style: italic">imperious</span> post, Marz.<br /><br />I think Karl covered it already, but let me reiterate:  the items will be completely replaced soon (as soon as we're finished designing them--we've hit a few rough patches that we want to get right so that we don't have to fix it again later), and we're already planning a week of balancing updates pre-Beta to tweak things like the effects of attributes, player damage, &amp;c.</div>

				<div class="content">sheesh nobody said hes got to do it EXACTLY like EJ did... aside from alpha I think there could be differences that make this game superior to xenimus and unique in its own way while still being familiar.... plus if ej listened to any of his players his game would have and still would be a very different... thank god we have karl who actually gives a damn. =D<br />Keep up the good work</div>

				<div class="content">Hmm, so as not to continue to Marz bashing.  <img src="./images/smilies/icon_smile.gif" alt=":)" title="Smile" />  I will agree that Karl, you are doing a mighty fine job at this game. The fact that its keeping the basic Xen concept is what i enjoy. All other MMO's are just click and watch your guy kill the thing, but Evidyon and Xen are more challenging and actually require skill than just time, and at least the player's thoughts are being taken into account. But i cant wait to see what this game evovles into by next year.</div>
