				<div class="content">Imagine that if you had knight and sorceror as the first classes and they could chose between 4 paths of magic at higher lvl like 25.<br />im imagening some sort of out of link guild/Order you can join that lets you achieve a new kind of magic once you hit a certain level, and each path leads to a different type of self defence, but once the paths join in a summoning ritual of some sort a seal will be formed which can summon powerfull magics.<br /><br />F.ex Seal of four paths Summons some demon to fight with you and your party or maybe increases damage at the begining of a boss fight, or maybe as Sex4cash said puts a seal on the ground where players are safe or the seal could go wrong and one of the players might die <img src="images/smilies/icon_twisted.gif" alt=":twisted:" title="Twisted Evil" /> .(you will need one player from each path to complete this ritual)<br /><br />Then its just a matter of finding out what the paths will be called.<br /><br />i was thinking something like Crimson, Azure , Emerald, Onyx<br /><br />The Order which trains you in the different paths is called the &quot;Guardian Order&quot;(they were created by the gods long ago to protect Geona and serve as powerfull instruments)<br /><br />(CK/S)Crimson Knight/sorceror<br />(AK/S)Azure Knight/sorceror       <br />(EK/S)Emerald Knight/sorceror   <br />(OK/S)Onyx Knight/sorceror       <br />Crimson leyshaper? etc (you get the idea)<br /><br />you would gain certain powers others could not gain and the game would be more varied and you could REALLY be an unique built character with unimaginable power.<br /><br />ive always had some love for special talents for each class and almost every rpg has it, old xen only had stats making difference and gear, but with this you could become crazy and from day 1 on a character you would have to put into mind what path you would chose once you were high enough cause they each increase different things.  <img src="images/smilies/icon_twisted.gif" alt=":twisted:" title="Twisted Evil" /> <br /><br /><br />Just an idea!</div>

				<div class="content">And yeah the story behind why there were 4 paths would be because each of the guardians chose their own path in developing power.<br /><br />anyway just an idea for what future high lvls could build on.</div>

				<div class="content">What Marz was saying somewhere in the beginning (amongst all those words I skipped over) reminded me of Ragnarok Online a little bit. Whereas if you wanted to change from a Novice to a First Level class you had to go to a particular establishment. (Mage Guild, Swordsman Association, Thief Guild, Merchant Guild, etc.) Then afterwards you had two choices within the Second Level class (Thieves becoming Assassins or Rouges, Swordsmen becoming Knights or Paladins)<br /><br />A little so-so on the Knight naming. I wouldn't go with Noir Knight, and Shadow Knight sounds a bit like mixing the stealth element of an Assassin with the brute or tank element of a Knight class (which I don't think we're going for, maybe a potential path though, just wondering) Onyx sounds alright because of of Knights being like strong and rock solid (tanking). Not to copy anything but a further example from RO: Swordsmen could go Knight or Paladin, Knights went Lord Knight and Paladins went Crusader.</div>

				<div class="content">Maybe simple class advancements would be alright.

				<div class="content">We don't have any plans for a skill/talent system in the immediate future.  Maybe we should make some.  I do believe that a skill system is an important part of a game, but we might end up putting it off till post-Beta (or even post-Commercial).  Since we'll be designing the class system for Beta, we'll take a look at it then.</div>

				<div class="content">I for my part am thinking a skill or talent system, not a &quot;path&quot; system.  Now some skills would still depend on other skills, so there would still be progression, but I think it makes more sense this way.  We haven't really talked about it yet, so there's no telling for sure.</div>
