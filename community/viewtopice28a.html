				<div class="content">Hi all!  We've had so many spam posts (dozens per day) that I have been ignoring all new postings on this site and not bothering to approve any posts.  Since your posts aren't made instantly public unless they've been approved the first few times, you've been invisible.  On top of that, I deleted everyone with no posts yesterday which may have erased some of you--if so, I'm sorry!  Post here and I'll approve your account asap.</div>
