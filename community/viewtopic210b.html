				<h3>Official Release Date - Saturday, April 15</h3>

				<div class="content">We're going to have a Born to Rule release.  It's will be on Saturday, the 15th of April.
<br />
<br />TWO WEEKS BEFORE this date (the 1st of April), I want the following to be in my hands:
<br />
<br />Joe's &quot;design document&quot;-chat about Born to Rule.  Say 2+ pages (the more the better).
<br />Matt's 3 portraits.
<br />David's town models in their final state.
<br />
<br />By then I will be at the point where I'm implementing world components, and I will be able to get a working version by Saturday, April 8th.  At this meeting we will set up the server at Matt's house.
<br />
<br />The last week will be for testing/preparation of the website, advertising, and other such fun stuff.
<br />
<br />Then, on the 15th, I will make unseenstudios.com point over this way and put our download on the front page.
<br />
<br />
<br />Everyone ready?</div>

				<div class="content">I'm ready.  I'll keep working on the design doc, though I sent the skills doc to you already.
<br />
<br />Also, instead of meeting April 8, could we possibly meet on the afternoon of the 9th?  The Goodman's taekwondo tournament is on the 8th, so I'll be gone all day... <img src="./images/smilies/icon_biggrin.gif" alt=":D" title="Very Happy" /></div>
