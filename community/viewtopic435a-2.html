				<div class="content">My internet is pretty fast normally on other games but the reason i'm asking is because i was completely lag free when i first started 1.11. Just the last couple imes i've logged on i've lagged out every few mins. <img src="images/smilies/icon_confused.gif" alt=":?" title="Confused" /></div>

				<div class="content">This could be due to fluctuations in the network where the server is hosted.  As far as I know, the server's connection isn't dedicated so others' usage could be affecting this game.  I also have periods of high latency.</div>

				<div class="content">I too have been having lag problems, usually after about 40 minutes of play, and while running quickly or gassing.<br /><br />It's a strange and irritating effect:  my character will cease to respond to my commands and appear to continue running in the last direction pointed, but every once in a while the screen will flash back to where the character was when the problem started, usually getting pounded by enemies.  Eventually I'll find myself at the square, having been killed and lost my items, but with no idea of where my body lies ...<br /><br />I had figured it was a network problem on my end, but I'll mention it here in case it helps.</div>

				<div class="content">That is intriguing.  I have not observed this effect, so I will keep it in mind.<br /><br />I'm thinking I might need to rework world-interaction on the client side.  It shouldn't be too difficult to iron out errors the second time around.</div>
