			<div class="content">Went trolls at lvl 10 found out that they hurt a little but it was fine grinding them until i had 5k left and i started lagging, then suddenly if i had just an inch of delay it would mean my death, had azuremist mitts or something lost them my russet rapier bone mail, everything lawl just by lagging inn trolls two times.<br /><br />Suggesting that the trolls dont respawn that quikly so you get to clear one spot move down clear that and come back to more trolls instead of them spawning in your face.<br /><br />the bug when u can walk though fences Still works i just spam click the other side and it works:)<br /><br />Putesco gives me a lag of 10 seconds(only 3 seconds are deadly were i grind) if you press it more than once within a short period of time.<br /><br />Troll spot seemed a lil empty, you could remove the trees there and put som dirt spots and some &quot;furniture&quot; like chopped down trees bonfire with a dead human being cooked. and the trolls could be more gray-ish, they all reminded me of Big indians and orcs(cuz of the green)<br /><br />Graveyard could need some darker texture dirt, and probably some kind of holes which would resemble something having escaped from the grave.<br /><br />also i think there should be like 3-4 gates to the GY. <br /><br />ill try getting some skills on Blender etc to create something myself and i could post it later.</div>

What if you had this ability to make a kind of armor of the body (only reference I can think of is in Naruto) where Gara compacts sand onto his body (LuL) but instead we would create blood armor/flesh armor..
