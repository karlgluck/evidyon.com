				<div class="content">Alright so I saw that you wanted most of the sounds to be synthesized somehow, not using a guitar or piano or what. So i have a program where I can alter and  synthesize various sounds. I know this isn't the right thread but the music thread seems to be dead. I have begun making a long..i guess song? compiled with various sound effects and possibly a song or something for a dungeon or a general idea of what i can do. I will try to upload it somehow when it is completed so everyone can take a look and let me know if its something worth pursuing. <br /><br />On a side note I am very excited about PV and its potential. The community here is great.<br /><br />Sounds are written in .aif until I can find a free converter to .ogg (yes these are written on a mac) so finding a converter has proven to be rather difficult to this point. Quicktime plays .aif and a lot of people have itunes so please listen!<br /><br />Update:<br />Dungeon Sounds.<br /><a href="http://www.zshare.net/download/16900382fe282e94/" class="postlink">dungeon.aif - 7.40MB</a><br /><br />Update:<br />Another just eerie dungeon sound. Just showing a couple different types of sounds I can do.<br /><a href="http://www.zshare.net/download/16928666d881868a/" class="postlink">dungeon1.aif - 5.05MB</a></div>
