				<div class="content">Hey everyone!<br /><br />So, to make a long story short--I need a bit more time.  I really am working my arse off day and night, but there always seems like there is more to be done.  Joe and I are meeting on a daily basis now and we are trying to cut as direct a path to pre-beta (then beta) as we can.<br /><br />Here's a YouTube video!  You'll notice it's a little rough--I'm holding the sword upside down, some of the monster animations are wacky, you can see off the edge of the map... whatever.  The game is working about 1000 times better now at its core.  You'll notice a few fun things in the video:  leap, attack run, bow-spin, hidden areas, swimming, walls that hide visibility, portals, dimension door (a portal from where you are to where you click), a buff, toggled character names, merchants (including a wacky guy that you can hit to find out how much damage you deal), multi-projectiles, lighting.<br /><br />There are even more things implemented that aren't shown:  my brother has custom-modeled and animated 4 completely unique races and around 50 unique items.  There are bunches of other spell effects and spell types.  You can fall into pits...well, you get the picture.  There's a lot of new stuff in here.<br /><br /><!-- m --><a class="postlink" href="http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9tAx_HCq4s8">http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9tAx_HCq4s8</a><!-- m --><br /><br />Where does this leave us as far as release goes?  Well, here's what we want to finish first:<ul><li>Our guild system involving the Geosids - this is the biggest thing left to do and will probably take a week or so</li><li>Enchantments, area DOTs and a few other miscellaneous spells</li><li>Spell/ability design for the 6 new classes</li><li>Add a &quot;pvp zone&quot; where you can fight people without alignment loss or items dropping</li><li>A day or two of random bug-fixes and touch-ups (key-binding screen, make the launcher give an update message, etc.)</li><li>Import all of the media and design the pre-beta world</li><li>Polish things up and release</li></ul><br />As you can see, the list is fairly short.  I would be understand if you guys are a bit frustrated at this point, being as I have been saying &quot;soon&quot; and then retreating to my world of code <img src="images/smilies/icon_confused.gif" alt=":?" title="Confused" />  However, I hope you trust that it's been for a good reason.  I can actually see the end of my &quot;pre-beta to-do&quot; list on the horizon, and what we have been crafting is <span style="font-weight: bold">far</span> more than just a Evidyon with nicer graphics and a few new features.</div>

				<div class="content">OH MAN are we getting close now!  I finished the bulk of the guild system yesterday--you can now form a guild, give it a custom name, talk to guild guild members, see a list of who's online, promote new leaders of the guild (you get text under your name that indicates your guild status, like &quot;Leader of TheDestroyers&quot;).  Guilds are saved between sessions, so you don't have to worry about re-joining after logging off anymore.  There can be up to 16 people in a guild.<br /><br />The next step that I'm starting today is to implement Geosids.  I don't want to spill the beans on this quite yet since I want to be sure it works well when implemented, but know that (1) you'll be able to own Geosids as part of a guild, (2) guilds will fight over Geosids, because you REALLY want to own one and finally (3) there will be a LOT of cool secrets involving Geosids and Geonite.</div>

There are no more major systems left to implement--just have to add in a few minor things, import media, debug and send it out.  I'll be emailing everyone I know and posting it all over the place so you'll definitely know when this happens =D</div>
