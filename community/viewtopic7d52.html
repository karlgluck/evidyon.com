				<div class="content">Well first off to let you inn on what me and snuggles tested.<br /><br />We wanted to test the spell dmg and damage of a knight, but what we found instead was quite amusing.<br /><br />Seems that if a player moves around enough he can dodge every spell/attack there is and flee from battle endlessly, but not beam(and beam is quite powerfull)<br /><br /><a href="http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Y9NhS6IQn-M" class="postlink">http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Y9NhS6IQn-M</a> Video of me and snuggles fighting.<br /><br />First battle is Carnage(26) vs Fearon(15) and you will see that carnage cant pin him down enough to kill him, and cant even hit him cause the movements are to fast.<br />Second battle is Mm4(23) vs Snuggles(26) you will probably see that i do get damaged(but it is because i am standing a little still trying to cursor aim snuggles with beam) then suddenly i kill him, and then again alot faster just by spamming.<br /><br />nr.1 We need gasform instead of the buff velos, this is because gasform is a transportation spell which moves quikly through trees and over waters and through mobs but it can be disrupted by caster monsters and enemy players.<br />Also we need gasform because we cant be moving 50kmh while pvping,&quot;should be a standard speed for everybody&quot;<br /><br />nr.2 all classes need some kind of disruptus.<br /><br />nr.3 knights probably could use a charge spell so they could attack a transing target, or we could even have stuns(but thats more ranger type class)<br /><br />nr.4 the protection spell impedare(i think?) should be boosted according to your wisdom and knights would gain a little amount of protection per str stat, and wisdom should not give magic defence, only armors should give that.<br /><br />Any one else got something to add to the list?</div>
