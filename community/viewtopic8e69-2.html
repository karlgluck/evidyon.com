				<div class="content">I'm not sure if the hp/mp bars are really an issue (allthough the option to make it transparent wouldn't hurt anyone), the way the pop-up menu behaves atm has been adressed.</div>

				<div class="content">I think the option of having the bars in a chosen position would be nice.<br /><br />1. Top-left (horizontally)<br /><br />2. Bottom-left (Xen-style/vertically)<br /><br />3. Centered bottom (current style/horizontally)<br /><br />4. Character-surrounded (wow-style on either side of the character/curved vertical)<br /><br />I think they should look a lot better than they currently do... maybe some kind of animated texture for the color, with the bars more &quot;attached&quot; to the screen.</div>
