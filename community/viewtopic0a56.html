				<div class="content">We cant have a spell that lets you attack AND run superspeedy.<br />we need mutatio flamma and Gasform.<br /><br />We used to travel as low lvls through forests with gasform, we used to get dispelled by mage monsters, we used to be able to travel across water with it.<br />We used mutatio flamma to gather ogres and then blast them down.<br />And only rangers would get superspeedy not normal knights.<br /><br />Also to add a suggestion some player said to me online, Buffs should show an icon by the hp/mana/exp bar like on xen.<br /><br />Velocitas = attack speed only, increases the speed of the player melee<br />Robur = Attack power of melee, gives the player some damage with weapons.<br />Tutela = protection, gives the player like 30 defence (tutela is latin for protection i think)<br />Vis Vires = force, power, strength, might, increases the spell dmg a little.<br /><br />something xen did not have a spell dmg buff!<br /><br />And something xenimus didnt really have, a somekind way of counting your damage, which would make people interested in certain ways of using their magic for full dmg potentiall.<br /><br />like on wow. where there says all your int str hp wis defence and close to there the weapon pluss your str should be calculated to what would be &quot;hitting dmg&quot;</div>

Wizards would wear it all the time, and it would basically amount to a universal rise in damage.  Also, didn't Xen have the star spell that would do this?<br /><br />-Joe</div>

				<div class="content">I've always thought elemental protection spells would be cool.  For example: Ignis Teuri, which would give increased defense against the element of fire, but would also weaken you against ice.  This would add a little bit of defensive strategy.  Just a thought.</div>
