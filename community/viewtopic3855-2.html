				<h3>The Focus of PV</h3>
				<div class="date"><img src="./styles/prosilver/imageset/icon_post_target.gif" width="11" height="9" alt="Post" title="Post" />Posted: <strong>Sun Aug 05, 2007 6:39 am</strong></div>

				<div class="content">Okay, so with all the debates running around, I think it's possible that people have lost focus of what PV will become in the immediate future, and I'd like to remind everyone what the whole point is of what I'm doing.  This game will, as exactly as possible, re-implement Xenimus just before the spell update that started the majority of screwing everything up.  After that, we switch all of the content, change the names, make new maps, and implement MINOR adjustments to how the game works in order to balance things out.  This whole new-classes and progressions idea, making LSAs work differently, etc. is cool but that IS NOT HOW THE GAME WILL WORK on the main server.  Different rules can be implemented later and may become entirely different games; however, Project Volucris is about going back to where EJ went wrong--and you have to admit, he did a lot of stuff right before that otherwise we wouldn't even be here.
<br />
<br />In other words, focus your energy on describing as much of what Xenimus USED to be like and note what you liked/didn't like about it.  Don't try to create a whole new game at this point, or we'll be shooting for a moving target and this thing will NEVER get finished.</div>

				<div class="content">i enjoy xenimus as it is now, i just cant stand ej.
<br />
<br />things i like about xen 
<br />
<br />-bags
<br />-fast pace action
<br />-old character models
<br />-BEING ALBE TO MAKE ANY CHAR WITH ANY STATS. (Ratiotile is driving me insane, its like im talking to a brick wall, that reapeats what say, and continues on about his idea.)
<br />-i <span style="text-decoration: underline">did</span> enjoy how difficult the game <span style="text-decoration: underline">WAS</span> in leveling, (get rid of lava imps!)
<br />
<br />these are some things i would like to keep such as bags, but seems a few people are against them.
<br />i never had a strong mage before the update so i dont feel any pain over the spell update. i always made pallys =P</div>

				<div class="content">Does this mean aside from the game mechanics we'll also be using the xenimus maps?
<br />
<br />Game mechanics should obviously function as classic xen, that's pretty much the whole basis of this project.
<br />
<br />Maps on the other hand should be new or improved upon. Half the fun of classic xen was not knowing the maps, leaving a sense of mystery and exploration. Although I do think it might be too much to faithfully recreate a new map the same size of xen's, changing certain dungeons and towns I feel would add a lot to the player's experience.</div>

				<div class="content">The maps will be entirely new, but I was trying to get across that the gameplay will be very similar.  The foundations shouldn't be completely rebuilt--just expanded upon.</div>

<br />Vitriol, having a different opinion is fine.  This is not a good way of expressing it.  Otherwise, we appreciate your support and value your input.</div>

				<div class="content">Well, you can think of the new systems as the next step, after emulating Xenimus. The way I'm designing the character system, the old Xenimus classes can be implemented easily. This means that the first server can have oldschool class system, and we can run an &quot;experimental server&quot; for testing.</div>
