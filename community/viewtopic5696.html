				<div class="content">I'd like to move <!-- w --><a class="postlink" href="http://www.unseenstudios.com/">http://www.unseenstudios.com</a><!-- w --> to point to this website (forum, really, until we get it up-and-running) on <span style="font-weight: bold">Saturday, March 25</span>.  That's the saturday after spring break.  For this to happen, I'd like to have a few things available.
<br />
<br />David:  Make renderings of all of your models from various angles.  Go crazy!  High detail, large, all the effects you want, and lots of them.  Try to get orthographic perspectives along the axes and visual ones at interesting angles.  If you can, make a video of some of Stan's animations.  DON'T add new animations, however--just use what you have, even if it's an older version.  Maybe stick a sword and shield on him.  Use various armour.  Generally, do what feels good and <span style="font-weight: bold">email</span> it to me (<!-- e --><a href="mailto:karlgluck@gmail.com">karlgluck@gmail.com</a><!-- e -->)
<br />
<br />Joe:  I need some tangible design.  Type up a description of how the skills/attribute system will work--even if it's not final, go with your best guess on what you want and explain all you want.
<br />
<br />Matt:  Have 3 character portraits ready (they don't have to be colored, a clean pencil drawing is fine) and select some pieces of artwork to showcase.
<br />
<br />I will have a working demo where people can log in to the game by the 25th, or I'll die trying.
<br />
<br />
<br />At that point, I want to switch the domains, have a lot of &quot;prefab&quot; posts up in the forums for people to reply to (jumpstart conversations, etc.), have some artwork on exhibit in the forums, and have a game for people to talk about.  We can also start re-releasing older content in order to keep the &quot;dev cycle&quot; up.</div>
