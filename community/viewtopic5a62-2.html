				<div class="content">I got this idea after using a program called Magic Workstation. If any of you play Magic the Gathering then you might know what I'm talking about. If you play and you still don't know, check it out, it's a good program.
<br />MWS has a card filter. I can filter the 100000+ card pool by including/excluding colors, rarities, types, and mana cost. This feature saves me a lot of time and is both easy to use and powerful.
<br />
<br />I envision a drop pickup filter in xenimus that is easier to use and can handle exclusions. For simplicity we will have 3 inputs. 
<br />The first would be minimum level to pick up, using the item level reqs. This could ignore accessories such as wands and gems or have a toggleable ignore. This way if I am hunting in isle I can set the filter to 4, so that I will only pick up fire staffs and higher and not be bothered with stopping to drop crap gear.
<br />
<br />The second input would be a list of items to always accept. If I was hunting for propping items for example I could turn the filter up to level 12 and put in opal, emerald, ring, etc. into the accept list. Now I only pick up gems, rings, and higher level items.
<br />
<br />The third input is optional and would be the exclude list. Any name you type here would not be picked up. If you are hunting supers and you put in 'magic staff', you will pick up everything permitted by the level filter but not magic staffs. 
<br />
<br />The accept list would always override the exclude list so if you put &quot;staff&quot; in the accept list while having &quot;magic staff&quot; in the exclude list you would pick up all staffs regardless. Notice how &quot;staff&quot; is a wildcard that includes any item with &quot;staff&quot; in it's name. This should be true of anything you type in the lists: mystic, spirit, etc.
<br />
<br />I think that this feature would be unobtrusive and take away some of the tediousness while hunting.
<br />
<br />As for implementing, I'm not exactly sure how Xen works. Is everything server-side? It would help if the filter could be run on client-side.</div>

				<div class="content">This could easily be implemented client-side, but it would work like this:
<br />
<br />client picks up as many items in stack as possible
<br />client checks list and picks items to drop
<br />client asks server to drop items
<br />
<br />I like the idea, by the way!</div>
