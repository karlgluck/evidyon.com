See all of you next week <img src="images/smilies/icon_biggrin.gif" alt=":D" title="Very Happy" />  I'm taking some R&amp;R...I've been putting in a bunch of time on this thing to get it going.  Just yesterday, I added equipment, made monsters aggressive, built a new world, created zones, added a bunch of new items, tried to make more sounds, and implemented spells for all of the classes.  Phew!<br /><br />Also, you'll notice the spells are all in a different language.  You're welcome.  It took a long time to make up a new language   <img src="images/smilies/icon_rolleyes.gif" alt=":roll:" title="Rolling Eyes" />  (latin wasn't doing it  for me)</div>

				<div class="content">Hey Karl, I love it man. Are those the only spells though? Or were you just trying out a specific class. I'm not sure=P But nevertheless it looks good. Only thing I can point out that I don't like to much is the character size, it seems a little big for the world, but other than that keep up the great work and I can't wait to try this out=)</div>

It seemed like it was running just a little sluggish.  Enjoy your vacation though, Karl. <img src="images/smilies/icon_smile.gif" alt=":)" title="Smile" /></div>

				<div class="content">Thanks for the comments everyone!  I've jumped on a computer to respond.<br /><br /><blockquote><div><cite>JSunJShineR wrote:</cite>Hey Karl, I love it man. Are those the only spells though?</div></blockquote><br />So I only actually SHOWED you about 1/5 of the spells.  If you look at that list, those are all of the spells in the game right now.  However, I'd like to make clear that content for this game is INCREDIBLY easy to add.  Once you know what kind of spell you want to make, it literally takes less than 5 minutes to add it to the game (including logging into the server and testing it out, then going back and tinkering a few times).  The same goes for new items, changing character sizes, adding new kinds of monsters, changing which items drop from various monsters, how those monsters attack and how they behave--everything is completely configurable.  So the hard part is the design; which is exactly how it should be.  Right now I haven't done thorough design, however, because I'm still having issues getting it to run properly on different hardware.  For example, it BSoD's my girlfriend's laptop when she logs into the world...<br /><br /><blockquote><div><cite>JSunJShineR wrote:</cite>Only thing I can point out that I don't like to much is the character size, it seems a little big for the world</div></blockquote><br />Yep.  The character I'm playing with is also a &quot;Giant&quot;, but since there are no other players it's hard to tell =)<br /><br /><blockquote><div><cite>thadiusofx3 wrote:</cite>What is your FPS while running the game?</div></blockquote><br />Rock solid 60 FPS.  However, my laptop REALLY doesn't like running multiple monitors while recording at 30 FPS (which drops the frame rendering rate, but not the game speed, making it look choppier) and running the client and server simultaneously.  When not recording, it runs great though!</div>
