				<div class="content">Hook you? <br /><br />I was thinking about this and one thing that <span style="font-style: italic">really</span> stuck out was castles and beam. I remember watching higher level players beaming each other and that was my motivation to level, also castles. Those were a lot of fun. I use to try to take the castle just about everyday. The same owner would kill me then let me join him and mess around in his castle. So yeah... I think setting up signature moves for classes and then placing them say 15-20 levels away from 1 would be great motivation for people to level and stick with the game. And then having some sort of castle wars would be sweet and could be a nice change of pace from hunting. It would also draw people to one location for PVP.<br /><br />So why did Xenimus hook you?</div>

				<div class="content">Ahha.. Well for some weird reason the thing that got me was simply getting strong, since most of my friends were like 30-40 just to get to a high enough level or even become stronger then them ^^  as well as simply just to be able to keep up with them in Raiding castles / PvP with them of course  Plus the Spells got me as well, even though I at the time my friend had a 39 wizard and still said the fighter was the best in game (Till of course the spin got as fucked) so I lvled my fighter to 29 and then the nerf happend, so I made a wizard, didn't like it much, but then I made a warlock and fell in love with it simply at level 6 (True love  <img src="images/smilies/icon_mrgreen.gif" alt=":mrgreen:" title="Mr. Green" /> ) the gas cloud made me orgasm every time   <img src="images/smilies/icon_biggrin.gif" alt=":D" title="Very Happy" />  and leveled it to 34 as fast as I could till the item wipe happend.. I also really liked the high lvl items (even when I had a few of them, they just made more) but of course my favorite thing was wanting to be a good PvPer since that was the best thing at the time (And still is I suppose) <br /><br />The thing that made me hate the game was the dip-poo maker (EJ  <img src="images/smilies/icon_evil.gif" alt=":evil:" title="Evil or Very Mad" /> ) my guess is what he thought is &quot;Players? pfft, who needs players&quot; lolish but what I hated most is loosing XP (Massive bummer at lower lvls, and de-leveling was the WORSE) even though after 27 or so you loose max of 50000 XP (or something like that) but when you can't level as much as you want, it kinda sucks.<br /><br />I'm sure I would still be playing Xenimus if the item wipe didn't occur lol..</div>

Even more so if you are targeting not only hardcore but more casual players as well. Take WoW for example, there is no risk in that game what so ever, you can never lose anything no matter the circumstance, it is a casual players dream and the hardcore players don't seem to mind either but i guess they play for the over-arcing stories, visuals and epic encounters in atmosphere and stature.

				<div class="content">hey i just did a google search for my online name, skotup, and i found this cos my name was mentioned. People are still talking about me, lol, what a looser i was 10 years ago, wasting my life away. was fun tho, in the end i was the only one to use the sword of evil cos it made you evil, not good for every1else but made no difference to me lol. Dropping all my loot with baby seal clubbin just out of town then picking it up with another char, selling it, buying items, dropping the items, logging back on with BSC then picking them up was a pain but hey, i was evil 24/7. I remember EJ put a stop to my fun with magic bags and reditus amulets. Also put a stop to me and my mate (forgot his xen chars name now), my mate had that mystic blade that you could pick people up with and take them off the square to where i was just outside of town, spin-spin (no damage to my mate who was linked) hi-larious! He also used to take mages through portals into the middle of the ocean then sell them a port scrol for over-inflated prices lol... EJ took the mystic blade off us <img src="images/smilies/icon_sad.gif" alt=":(" title="Sad" /> When houses 1st came out 1 of the aussies hacked the map, saw where all the houses were and we ended up owning over half of the houses hahahaha. Then there was the old port some1 to the entrance of the house (cos u couldnt mark inside it) but place a skeleton on the entrance, the victim would slide right on in lol.</div>
