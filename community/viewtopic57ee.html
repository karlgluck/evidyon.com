Depending on your level, depends how much dept you gain, and you wouldn't start gaining dept till.. I'll say 5, ( I have'nt seen the interface for volucris yet but the XP bar would be yellow and how ever much dept you have would be a red line above the xp bar... OR you can put a dept count somwhere around the xp bar..<br /><br />You can throw in anything you think could be add or is necessary..<br /><br />But definitely shouldn't have xp loss, which is a total buzz kill =[</div>

				<div class="content">What an original idea! This idea would work great for PV, it's basically taking Xenimus's system and making it better in the sense that..<br />- Players don't get deleveled but still &quot;lose xp&quot; (or &quot;gain debt&quot;)<br />- Players don't have to &quot;make-up&quot; lost exp. This was very frustrating in xen because you literally just felt like you were just robbed of a couple hours of your life. With a system like this you can still gain exp, and even level up, but at a slower-rate until the debt is cleared.<br /><br />As for the amount of exp-loss (or debt-gained) I think it should be 0-5% w/ an LSA, 10-20% without.</div>
