				<div class="content">The new and shiny system that lets anyone add content to the game should be around sometime within the next two weeks.  I'm almost done with the map rendering component, and after that I only need to add the ability to edit the template panel in the map editor.  Woo!

				<div class="content">The map rendering component can now do ground types!  Although this may seem like a step backward, in fact it marks progress.  The old map system is significantly slower and didn't support the ability to hide parts of the map based on where the user was (things beyond solid walls were always drawn) but this map system can do that.  Additionally, any ground type can be defined by the user: all you have to do is specify a unique ID for that type, declare special attributes (such as being a low, medium, high or impassable wall, being a fluid, or a pit) and  pick a texture.
<br />
<br />Next up, I need to make the rest of the ground types work (I haven't made the code for the pits/walls yet) and then move on to static models.  I'm sorry this is taking longer than I expected, but trust me--it will be worth it.</div>
