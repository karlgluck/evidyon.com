				<div class="content">what sankt pauli said i think was a good idea, but it seems a lot like diablo &gt;.&gt;<br /><br />honestly i think there should be 2 different port systems, one to have like 5 ports that you can use to go anywhere, and then another that lets you &quot;mark&quot; 3 different safe squares, like say, different towns sell different items, you know?</div>

Just a little one to pick the brains?<br /><br /><br />Richard <img src="images/smilies/icon_razz.gif" alt=":P" title="Razz" /></span></div>

				<div class="content">The idea is not bad, it aims at the &quot;skipping content&quot; part. But it would also mean that newbies can't porthop others but their ports can be hopped by every higher level, which seems a bit unfair at a first glance to me.<br />I think instead of ports having level-requirements the areas themselves should have level-requirements. So if you're level1 and jump a port to a lvl12+ area you cannot enter. That way you don't really skip content, because when you're able to enter the lvl12+ area port you technically experienced the lvl1-12 content (even if you only killed twisted crawlers - you reached lvl12 therefore &quot;technically&quot; mastered the 1-12 content).</div>

				<div class="content">well i can see that there is alot of ideas here about this.<br />i personally liked the way that diablo portal system worked.<br />the problem with xenimus port is you have to hit stop action<br />to stop it and also that if you port everybody around can follow it.<br />so if you could come up with a way that maybe when someone <br />ports to a mark or an area that either their port closes or noone<br />could enter their port for like 10 seconds or something.<br />but whatever is decided on this issue is fine with me.<br />i just hope it isnt like wows is i really dont like theirs alot.<br />i also think that it should be level requirements for <br />certain areas. any how good luck everyone</div>
