				<div class="content">Simplicity? That is very far from the truth, have you even played WoW in depth? A excellent example of simplicity is Xenimus. What did every wizard PvP with? Beam. That's the only move people used. Yet this is complexity? Also warrior's used auto attack and spin. Must be another example of complexity right? <br /><br />As for anyone playing it and being good you couldn't be more wrong. Bad players are still bad players. Playing with a good player and then doing something with a bad player... It's kinda like the contrast of night and day.<br /><br />Honestly all Xenimus is = People with too much time on their hands killing people who have busy life's or people who are not as dedicated. Also saying WoW is a failure is like saying Bill Gate's is poor <img src="images/smilies/icon_smile.gif" alt=":)" title="Smile" /> And yes I play WoW and yes I am defending it because your statements are so absurd.</div>
