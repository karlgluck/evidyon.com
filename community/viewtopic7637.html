				<h3>Glich Notes: 12-11-09 (Read Before Playing)</h3>

				<div class="content">The following bugs and gliches could impair your gameplay.<br /><br /><img src="images/smilies/icon_arrow.gif" alt=":arrow:" title="Arrow" /> Some mobs are set at level 100 again.  This is similar to the Hard Trolls glich from the game's release.<br />The following are known gliched mobs-<br />-Kobold Castle Skeleton Archers<br />-South Dungeon Entrance Golems<br />-South Dungeon Hard Liches<br /><br /><img src="images/smilies/icon_arrow.gif" alt=":arrow:" title="Arrow" />Humans have 0/47626 mana at character creation<br /><br /><img src="images/smilies/icon_arrow.gif" alt=":arrow:" title="Arrow" />Lag, with a similar pattern to the previous lag phase.  Where the lag becomes exponentially worse until the game is absolutely unplayable.<br /><br />[My Theory]- The lag began today when Karl and I were on during the server back up.  He was exploring Kobolds and I was hunting trolls.  Both of us on mages.  I believe the use of lag creating spells during the server update may have disturbed some function in the programming.  Since the lag seemed to correct itself after a few days last time I presume that if nobody is on during the next server backup, the process will revert itself.  I only believe it is self-correcting because the developers did not post or announce that the bug was ever *fixed* last time.</div>

				<div class="content">I found all the mob level problems and have corrected them.<br />I tested the game after corrections on Thursday and now the Dungeon floor doesnt load.<br />Anyways, I have been out of town and that is why the lag was probably unbearable.  <br />It is running smoothly now. <br />The next Update maybe next week.  Just let me get through my exams until Friday; then I will have some free time.<br />I will log in from time to time to check lag, that is about it.</div>

				<div class="content">No the level fix has not been implemented.  I fixed them last week and compliled the game and tested it on my computer.<br />The problem is the South Dungeon Floor doesn't load now.  I just havn't messed with it since, because of Exams this week.<br />I am done on Friday and will be on Friday night or adding levels to the new area I have made.<br />Yesterday I did take a break and add 3 more hidden rooms and another small area to grind in.  I also added many more spawn points so the hall on my level<br />is a little crowded to get through.  There will be plenty of exploring after this is done.  <br />The size of the map after I am done with the monster adding, will be about 2x the size of the original Southern Dungeon.</div>

I may need to cut back their spawn points now that they are acually level 50's.<br /><br />Not fixed:<br />-Being unable to port until way outside of town square<br />-Skeleton Archers at the Mystwalker Castle.  I can't find the game files on them and don't know their levels, as a matter of fact, i can't seem to figure out how they are in the game without spawn point and level files.  I will do some more looking.</div>

After you have installed the update of course.</div>
