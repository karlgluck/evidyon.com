				<div class="content">The guild will be named &quot;The Ravenous&quot;(meaning hungry/greedy, i first saw the word Ravenous on a movie about cannibals by the same name <img src="./images/smilies/icon_twisted.gif" alt=":twisted:" title="Twisted Evil" /> )<br />The guild will be Hierarchic, meaning we will be ranked from Trial to Guild leader, i was thinking ranks according to the 7 deadly sins.<br /><br />Pride is excessive belief in one's own abilities, that interferes with the individual's recognition of the grace of God. It has been called the sin from which all others arise. Pride is also known as Vanity.<br /><br />Envy is the desire for others' traits, status, abilities, or situation.<br /><br />Gluttony is an inordinate desire to consume more than that which one requires.<br /><br />Lust is an inordinate craving for the pleasures of the body.<br /><br />Anger is manifested in the individual who spurns love and opts instead for fury. It is also known as Wrath.<br /><br />Greed is the desire for material wealth or gain, ignoring the realm of the spiritual. It is also called Avarice or Covetousness.<br /><br />Sloth is the avoidance of physical or spiritual work, what you would call lazy.<br /><br />We will decide which rank you suit best after some days trial.<br /><br />The Guild will have no offical leader as we all are one band of brothers united by thoughts, goals and personalities.<br />The Leader of the guild &quot;Pride&quot; will however work as a planner of raids/boss fights and a gatherer of troops.<br /><br />Joining &quot;The Ravenous&quot; means you are part of the family and the rest of us are likely to fight for you.<br />Others will be slain on sight most likely, though we of course apreciate allegiance outside guild.<br /><br />Already part of the family:<br /><br />Maximus Macigos IV Rank:Pride<br />Carnage Rank:Gluttony<br />Gonzo Rank:Sloth<br />Beer Nipples Rank:Lust<br />The Devil may cry: not yet decided<br />Soujiro: new member<br /><br /><span style="color: #FF0000"><span style="font-size: 150%; line-height: 116%;">Welcome to The Ravenous!</span></span><br /><br /><img src="http://img98.imageshack.us/img98/6055/ravenous.png" alt="Image" /></div>
