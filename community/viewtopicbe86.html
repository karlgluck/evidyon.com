				<div class="content">These are the three bugs that I've found so far from regular play.<br /><br /><span style="font-weight: bold">Bazaar Bug</span> - Whenever I go into the Bazaar on any character to check items listing, and I stay/continue to view items for around 30 seconds or more, Evidyon freezes.  I have to force close the program and then log back in after the active character message goes away.  This bug is consistent and happens every time.<br /><br /><span style="font-weight: bold">Black Screen Bug</span> - I think I read somewhere that vista users are experience similar happenings.  I try to log into a character, and I get a black screen, but still hear in game noises.  It usually can be fixed by force closing the game, logging in and out as an alternative character, and then proceeding to try the original character once more.  This bug is less consistent.<br /><br /><span style="font-weight: bold">Vortex Bug</span> - If you press the key too fast, your character will not hit anything and the animation will often disappear. <br /><br />The bugs are experienced on both computers on which I've played.  The specs are as follows:<br /><br /><span style="font-weight: bold">Computer 1</span><br />Windows 7 RC1 32-Bit (Build 7100)<br />Intel T7200 Core 2 Duo 2Ghz<br />Nvidia GeForce 7700 Go (Driver Vers. 7.15.11.7967)<br />2GB RAM<br /><br /><span style="font-weight: bold">Computer 2</span><br />Windows 7 Beta 32-Bit (Build 7000)<br />AMD Athlon 64 3700+ 2.4Ghz<br />Nvidia GeForce 7600 GS (Driver Vers. 7.15.11.7943)<br />1GB RAM</div>

Alko?</div>

				<div class="content"><span style="font-weight: bold">Bazaar</span> - This is related to the Bazaar's cycling pages; I'm getting slightly different behaviour from the bug:  after 30 seconds or so viewing one page of listings, if I click over to another one nothing shows up; also, no list that contains items (inventory, equipped items, storage, any of the Bazaar lists) displays the items that were there (although I can go kill a monster and the loot will show up); and ESC won't log my character out.<br /><br /><span style="font-weight: bold">Log-on</span> - yeah, this one's nasty.  I've been having a lot of trouble with it myself.  Sometimes it will freeze all of my characters, but I've found that creating a new character and logging on with him immediately will usually get around this bug, and as you've said once one character is on the bug goes away.<br /><br /><span style="font-weight: bold">Whirlwind</span> - I think you mean Vortex, for which this is a known problem.  Nobody's mentioned that they've experienced this bug with Whirlwind, and I can't get it myself testing right now.</div>

				<div class="content">Hm.  I haven't been able to quite replicate the Bazaar bug, but there's certainly something wrong with the cycling mechanism--what seems to happen is that when you're looking at a page and it cycles, the item descriptions won't pop up until you click into another menu--the item name will flicker with highlight for a second but not stay highlighted or display the information.</div>

				<div class="content">Any spell effect (even if another player casts it) will stop the black screen.  Richard helped debug this one yesterday and found that if he messed with the pixel-shader settings on his graphics card, he was able to get it not to do that at all.  So apparently I'm missing setting a pixel-shader state.  I've added some code that should fix this.</div>
