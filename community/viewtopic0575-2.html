<br />
<br />the more the merrier I guess. I think some of the harder monsters of xenimus will have to made easier or they will just stand around, unchallenged for weeks on end. Of course, there should always be enemies with need big groups to defeat.</div>

<br />I remember the megaspawns the most. Theres nothing like being jumped by 50 rogues every other screen. THAT WAS FUN. Who needs hunt isle? go hunt rogues! 
<br />
<br />hahaha. That was great.
<br />Hey maybe if P.V. is more stable then xenimus then once a week for like 2 hours the spawn can go nuts. That would be loads of fun.</div>

				<div class="content">thinking about something, the superspawn was insane fun, but can anyone remember meeting the &quot;bugged&quot; monsters? I never got an answer if it was a bug or if it was
<br />ment by ej to have, but monsters who had insane amount of hp, often one shotted you and often dropped good items. some of em killed alot of people and picked up their stash, ( i remember one being in rouges in ds, he dropped over 255 maxies and mystic staff) and another one in t2 ds who dropped a diab staff. would be alot of fun to have some monsters who spawns random places that could kill your bum easy. better then having a spider to raid.
<br />
<br />just my 2 cents</div>
