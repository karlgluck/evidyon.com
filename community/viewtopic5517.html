				<div class="content">Okay.
<br />
<br />To do list = 
<br />
<br />1. First thing i Noticed when loging in, is that when you go to you password it doesnt automaticly go to the tab, well make it do that.
<br />
<br />2. As well when you close Volucris, it doesnt remember your account later on.. Fix that
<br />
<br />3. I noticed the &quot;Theif&quot; on the list, i think you should put it back to Ranger, but I cant be certain, you might have plans on this build..
<br />
<br />4. Prolly a small thing, but make the list of the genre you are (Dreg, Human, ect) Make it a list from human to least human I would do, Human, Dreg, Elf, Gnome, Scallion.
<br />
<br />5. Also accounts dont seem to even need a password, I thought this was pretty funny, You might need to fix it tho.
<br />
<br />6. Characters dont need a name either..  <img src="images/smilies/icon_biggrin.gif" alt=":D" title="Very Happy" />  do wat ya can bout that..
<br />
<br />7. Fix the roughness of the ground, cause it seems to be just basic square labels from what im looking at &gt;.&gt;
<br />
<br />8. Make things solid.. From what I'm seeing you can basicly walk through anything..
<br />
<br />9. I like the walking on water thing, honestly i think you should make that a power for warlocks are wizards/both..
<br />
<br />.. thats all I can tell ya what to fix Right now since its only alpha im looking at
<br />
<br />
<br />Dont DO~!
<br />1. Do NOT make potions Heal/Regenerate/recover over time~!
<br />
<br />2. Do NOT make it possible to &quot;Square Hop&quot; after fighting som1 [like they do in Orseth Usually]
<br />
<br />3. Dont make it possible to loose xp from other people or Monsters that are more then 10+ levels higher then you...
<br />
<br />Dont Not Worry About = 
<br />
<br />1. Do N0T worry about makeing &quot;professions&quot; in xenimus THIS is the -&gt;Least&lt;- of your worrys, honestly I dont think Vol needs it at all..
<br />
<br />
<br />
<br />Thats all im gonna put out there for now.. since you prolly got alota do, and Ima go play some xenimus XD</div>

				<div class="content">Hey Rabit, thanks for your input!  I'm going to be adapting the old code to the new client come January, and it's really nice to have a list of things that needed to be fixed.  Just a note, the reason you can walk through things is because there was no good way of setting what was solid in the world in the map editor.  That's all changed now, though <img src="images/smilies/icon_smile.gif" alt=":)" title="Smile" /></div>

				<div class="content">yea alot of the things you have listed are still in the works. 
<br />
<br />and yes mana potions and heal potions would be instant. not slowly regenerate or have any cool down. however there should <span style="font-weight: bold">NOT</span> be a potion/wand that heals 100% of your health 100% of the time &quot;wand of Mederi&quot; or if there is it shouldnt be as comon as a wand of mederi.
<br />
<br />i think professions would be highly beneficial to ANY game. imps shouldnt drop super uber gear. as they do in xenimus. how ever imps could drop the nessicary items needed to create a armor/shield/sword.
<br />
<br />monsters should drop leather, cloth, bones, skulls, claws, teeth, hair ect... and thoes items can be used in a profession to make stuff.
<br />
<br />Cloak of the fire imp...  <img src="images/smilies/icon_confused.gif" alt=":?" title="Confused" /></div>

But LATER on it will probably be created.. But its a very complicating idea as well.. I dont see a big reason to make professions since JUST leveling takes forever, gaining profession xp just makes it harder and more annoying.</div>
