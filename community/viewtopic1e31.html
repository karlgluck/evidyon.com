				<div class="content">I like the idea of alignment-based items, but I'm trying to avoid cutoff limitations because I feel they make the game less fun.<br /><br />For example, if you can't wear an item at all because you're not neutral, that kinda sucks.  Instead, I'd implement a system where you can wear it while lawful or chaotic (see my post on alignments that I'm about to make--not exactly the same as good/evil) but you get less of a bonus--or perhaps even a determent--by doing so.</div>

				<div class="content">Hey Karl and Axel,<br /><br />I have just been thinking (I know, me thinking? hide!) what about one specific item in the game, which its actual attributes are align based, say the something along the lines of:<br /><br /><span style="text-decoration: underline">The Staff of the Mighty</span><br /><br />Improves its attributes as you get higher alignment towards the good side, becomes extremely powerful when fully aligned good. When evil, is extremely weak.<br /><br /><br /><span style="text-decoration: underline">The Staff of the Devil</span><br /><br />Improves its attributes as you get lower alignment towards the evil side, becomes extremely powerful when fully aligned evil. When good, is extremely weak.<br /><br /><br />Lol obviously the names of the items are just for demonstrating.<br /><br /><br />All the best,<br /><br />Richard.</div>
