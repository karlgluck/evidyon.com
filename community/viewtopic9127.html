			<div class="content">Well the idea sprung out when some one started saying that evil players got all the crap, they would drop more items, and ofcourse theres a super negative effect of not being able to enter a town, unless there were neutral towns?<br /><br />Well, ofcourse there are players in every game that only intend to create chaos and kill &amp; steal as much as he can.<br />I was one of those players on Xenimus, and if the current alignment system would be used on Xen i would never really survive, losing all my gear just because i was evil, being evil was what i liked about xenimus, i lived like an outlaw killing selling and trading so i could create other chars.<br /><br />My suggestions are simple:<br /><br />Fair:<br />Players whom chose to walk the path of chaos should not lose more gear than a player whom wants to be kind and play fair.<br />You already lose benefits like entering towns whom are guarded and in a neutral town you could easily be killed, and by attacking other players you already take some risks.<br /><br /><span style="font-weight: bold">Bounty hunters:</span><br />Evil players should drop an item which you can sacrefice at geosid or sell to merchant and get cash/random rare items for, as a bounty for those whom are outlaws.<br /><br /><span style="font-weight: bold">Outlaw towns: </span><br />There should be Neutral towns for players whom chose to live a life of Pk &amp; theft.<br />The towns should have a square and some merchants whom were a little more expensive, storage and a bazaar linked to other towns.<br />The town should have 0 guards though so 0 protection from fellow outlaws, this would be a very dangerous area basically.(if you go evil you pay for it)<br /><br /><span style="font-weight: bold">Appearances: </span><br />I remember playing fable, if you went evil on fable your appearances would change, you're eyes would glow red, your hair would become gray, smoke would come of you like you were filled with ashes/cinders, and your spells would become more dark and mystic.<br /><br />Evil:<br /> you could get red eyes and there could come smoke of your body if you turned very evil, your skin color could become pale or dark(dunno), a pale lucan, dark lucan etc.<br /><br />Good: You could get wings or something like the volucris race had in the begining would be cool being &quot;angel like&quot; and maybe a crown of light?<br /><br />just some thoughts</div>

			<div class="content">Personally, I agree with marzuku on this issue (-all the hating in this thread). Why should pvpers drop more gear? If the guards are made right, and do their job, the pvper/pker has enough consequences as it is. It's harder to trade and get help from other players (fewer people like you/towns, which are trade hotspots, are guarded). This being said though, neutral town may be a bad idea (they take too much of the risk away), unless they have no safety zone.<br /><blockquote><div><cite>Vapore wrote:</cite>It's not fair that high levels can go around killing anybody they want. </div></blockquote><br />I'm confident that there will be good pve high level characters to ballance out the evil. PvErs are actually more likely to be higher levels, because they spend more of their time leveling and exploring, and less time pking. If pvpers worry you, join a good guild and help eachother out.</div>

			<div class="content">As much as I dislike most of the ideas discussed in this thread, I was thinking about it at work today, and I think there are some ideas that could be implemented in the game that aren't detrimental to the G&amp;C system.  I wrote them down and will copy them here later.<br /><br />And as a matter of fact, Kansas City is the home to the Kansas City Speedway, a prominent NASCAR track, that makes me most of my money serving BBQ a mile away.  I will not apologize for my euphemisms.  I could have just as easily said skydiving, rockclimbing, or running into battle, only it would have been naive, because wtf would I know about skydiving, rockclimbing or running into battle.<br /><br /><blockquote><div><cite>marzuku wrote:</cite>which just actually proves the point of you being the wrong person to criticise me, the kind that played pve and wouldnt know what i meant? have you ever been high lvl and tried fighting the urge to just kill every one, just because you could? its freaking hard! <br /><br />The original game was made so that people would kill eachother for riches and honor, that was about 80% of the fun of xen.<br /></div></blockquote><br /><br />A high level character who has resisted the urge to steal other players gear would do so for the right to have his great gear 70% protected, would still losing his hard earned gear 1/3 rd of the time, and would have to hard earn more gear in order to keep that 70% protection.

However, PvPing people trying to level should. If you really want to full time PvP and kill every person you find, go ahead. Nobody is stopping you. Thankfully, going evil will have it's consequences. I honestly think it's a fair trade off. Why are you arguing with me? Hell, I think Karl agrees. Just don't get killed.<br /><br />*You can???t <span style="font-weight: bold">eat your cake</span> and have it too*<br /><br />Just for clarification, this is the only thing I'm completely against in your post.<br /><blockquote class="uncited"><div>Fair:<br />Players whom chose to walk the path of chaos should not lose more gear than a player whom wants to be kind and play fair.<br />You already lose benefits like entering towns whom are guarded and in a neutral town you could easily be killed, and by attacking other players you already take some risks.<br /></div></blockquote></div>

			<div class="content">Although both sides do have good arguments, I'd like to point out that the main reason we have the current system is to make griefing/trolling newbies by repeatedly killing them as a high level character unappealing.  There are several factors that go into the alignment system we created to help balance this out.  Let me first say that we are <span style="font-weight: bold">NOT</span> against PKing in any way.  In fact, the alignment system allows you to kill any good character once per day and it wont affect your alignment at all!  The key is moderation.  Killing a few people every day makes your alignment drop slowly over time, but even if you kill a few people every day for a week, chances are you won't go evil as long as you had a decent alignment to start off with.<br /><br />If you want to be evil and kill a LOT of people in a short period of time, go for it--you'll pay the consequences by making yourself a target.  As was already discussed, there is plenty to gain on this route--fame, items, revenge, etc.  Plus, if you really want to trade you can always go into town on another character.   Perhaps there will even be a PK guild at some point where all the characters are Destroyers, who knows?<br /><br />For the time being, this system is not going to change.  The very fact that you, a self-stated pk lover, don't want to pk all the time is a testament to how well it is doing its job.   <img src="images/smilies/icon_wink.gif" alt=":wink:" title="Wink" />  <br /><br /><br />That said, I'll be adding a pvp zone in the next couple updates so everyone can test out pvp.  Once I'm convinced it's balanced, I'll consider lowering penalties.</div>

			<div class="content">I am short on time and briefly read over all of this but I have not seen any significant arguments stating one of the clear advantages of going evil in the present system. If you decide to follow the path of &quot;evil&quot; you can still have another character which you put all of your &quot;good gear&quot; and your &quot;loot&quot; on and have no not have to worry about the crappy gear which you keep on your PK character. If you are smart about the current system you can work it to your advantage. I think if the rules slacken much and it does become easier for a pk character it leaves alot of room for noob pking abuse and such. So in conclusion I am quite happy with the current system.<br />Thanks<br />Willy</div>
