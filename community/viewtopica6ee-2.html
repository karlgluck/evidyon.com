				<h3>What each stat does</h3>

				<div class="content">This is what I think each stat should do. It's only slightly changed from Xenimus. The goal here is to make each stat useful to every class.
<br />
<br />Strength: melee dmg, carry wt, bit of hp, weapon skills
<br />Agility: AC, to-hit, walk/cast/attack speed, weapon skills
<br />Constitution: more hp, poison resist, swim, rage
<br />Intelligence: bonus exp, mana, most attack spells, skill points
<br />Wisdom: mana, defense spells, heal, resists, spirit magic, buffs, detection magic
<br />
<br />Strength should give a bit less HP than it does now, so that Constitution is more useful to fighters.
<br />
<br />Let Agility affect casting speed so that it isn't wasted on mages.
<br />
<br />What can I say about Consitution? Basically all it does is give HP.
<br />
<br />Intelligence should give a bit more bonus EXP( in Xenimus it's 1 point per point in Intelligence). It should also increase the rate of skill points per level, to make it more useful all around.
<br />
<br />Wisdom needs a little boost. Let it affect buffs and detection magic.
<br />
<br />Both Intelligence and Wisdom should give mana. I don't really like the idea of having a primary magic stat and the other one giving no MP. We will see more balanced mages this way.</div>

				<div class="content">Very nice, Also since we are around this subject... Make it so whenever you cast a armor spell you see your Total Armor # turn blue and increase so you can see what exactly you got, same with str buff/speed/etc... stats turn blue if they r buffed and increase to the given amount. also have a timer on the buff icons to see how much longer you have till u need recast.</div>

<br />
<br />Rather than a timer, (its too precise) just have the icon begin to blink as you run out of time. And it blinks faster and faster until it goes out.</div>

				<div class="content">Agreed. A timer can be hard to read out of the corner of your eye. How about icons that fade, or shrink?</div>
