				<div class="content">Just some thoughts about where abouts and sizes of crypts.<br /><br />i think the current gy crypt is rather large and that the dragons should be moved to the mountains in a cave called maybe &quot;Dragon lair&quot; and maybe could be made so that in the end of the dragon lair in a room the &quot;Broodmother&quot; big bum dragon would reside. also you could add several different dragons, fire breathing ones and azure dragons which would breathe ice or something and drop of items like the ice scimitar/fire sword etc.<br /><br />The Crypt spirits at gy could be put in the swamp with the entrance being by the lush oasis in the middle with skulls surrounding as a symbol of death and decay. the spirits down there should be recalled and retextured maybe into a darker colour signalizing a real evil spirit.<br />As ghost lore tells us spirits become more powerfull the longer they are around and get even more blood thirsty.<br /><br />Spirit=agressive soul<br />Doleo(latin for pain)= old tormented soul<br /><br />The crypt could be downsized and introducted to spiders hounds and whatever and maybe hold of some low lvl chests later or mana pools like in Old wars, t1 gy(which had several pools hidden which experienced players would portal to and get filled up before hunting on)<br /><br />just saying that instead of cramping them into one huge badass dungeon you should let them have their own dungeons, i just thought it was unlogical with dragons underground in a maze and they being lvl 30 or whatever and captured by whom? exactly. <img src="images/smilies/icon_smile.gif" alt=":)" title="Smile" /> <br /><br />Also huge bum dungeons should be for insane events like shrines/bosses/star etc.</div>
