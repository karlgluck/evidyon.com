Also, the min level crap on Xen pissed me off, I hope it isn't used here. <br /><br />It is a bit premature to be listing this stuff, there will blatantly be shops, defined hunting areas, safe squares, party system (already documented by Karl) and improved classes (Karl has already stated that the classes were a last minute addition to give us something to play with) added in time.</div>

				<div class="content">Zoom out the camera a bit more, transport is nearly worthless with how fast you can walk with 2 pieces of &quot;speed&quot; gear.  Increase the screensize to fullscreen or limit the mouse cursor to the edge of the window (keep clicking on my desktop lol). Also, i'm not sure if it is just lag, but sometimes none of my hotkeys will register, i.e. transport, heal, damage spells - but I can still click somewhere and my char will start walking.</div>

				<div class="content">Definately agree with trying to fix the &quot;getting stuck in monster&quot; bug. Outside of that however, if possible it would be nice to see an auto-attack similar to that in Xenimus (i.e. have a new key like &quot;auto-strike&quot; and click a monster and you will begin following/attacking that monster). And I know the game is very buggy due to it only being at the beginning stages of development, but I was wondering is monster speed could be slightly reduced? Maybe I just suck, or lag too much, but it seems difficult at times to use single target spells (like Vex Hydra something) and successfully click the same target multiple times, heh.. Possibly put a larger click radius on single target spells so that you only have to click &quot;near&quot; the monster as opposed to on the model itself. Anyways, just a few suggestions =) And thank you for zooming the camera out, very useful - allows for more reaction time and quicker travelling.</div>

Speed spells should probably add a kind of fade off behind you (like your moving so fast there's copys of you behind you) or add some sort of effect to show that your moving faster, or keep it hidden, its up to Karl.<br /><br />But a super-saiyan action is idiotic, to &quot;include disruptive auras&quot; (Which by the way, in DBZ the auras do absolutely NOTHING except look cool, If they had used that aura power for somthing better then just some useless kinetic aura) makes no sence.. We already are going to have the Egg, and the Devi from reg Xen (I think) lol, If anything..just add on to that..<br /><br />Also probably add a damage spells that add like 9% lightning dmg (Or just add a cetain amount of lighting dmg per-lvl-of skill like 20 for lvl 1, 50 for lvl 2, ECT) and make your weapon white (or yellow), poison make it green, fire make it red, so on and so forth.. and of course you can only have 1 of these <br /><br />And for damage spells on mages, it just adds dmg to what ever spell your using (probably a bad idea lol)<br /><br />AND don't remove teleport as a transportation skill, that was my favorite way of transportation in any game that had that skill.. unless there was a major delay on it  <img src="images/smilies/icon_evil.gif" alt=":evil:" title="Evil or Very Mad" /><br /><br />P.S:<br />These aren't even things the game needs, they're just ideas.</div>
