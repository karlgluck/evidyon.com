				<div class="content">Gold just stacks and stacks and stacks and stacks.  In the current system the most powerful player would have no use for (as he can get anything quickly by hunting) and therefore would rather use his items for geosids.  Therefore rarer items would never get sold at the merchant, therefore nobody would ever buy items except in rare cases that are not a general rule, and in those cases the prices would be extremely high.<br /><br />Gold has to be spent to have value.  Some ideas of how to give gold value.<br /><br />Make common consumables unavailable from geosids and make them purchasable and drop only. (provide a merchant that sells them)<br /><br />Have merchants out in the wilderness that you have to defeat difficult monsters to get to.  These would sell rarer items or rarer consumables.<br /><br />Set common consumable prices kind of expensive.  In hour of hunting a level 15 fighter should gather enough gold to buy aprx 5-10 trans wands.  This gives higher level players who are finding an abundance of wands an opening to undercut the merchants and sell cheap and still make a profit.<br /><br />Allow Guilds to sell permission to use their Geo's.  They could sell amulets that protect from the guardian and allow a one time or five minute use of the Geo.<br /><br />Make very rare purchasable guild benefits/items so that guilds have a reason to horde money.<br /><br />Make an exchange rate for geocite so that people can drop gold for Geo items.<br /><br />*Editted for a new idea and to make my opening economic theory make more sense*</div>

				<div class="content">I completely agree!<br />Morn said, &quot;Have merchants out in the wilderness that you have to defeat difficult monsters to get to. These would sell rarer items or rarer consumables.&quot; This sounds like an awesome idea, have like a dungeon with a final boss guarding a high class merchant. Make it too difficult to solo! <img src="images/smilies/icon_smile.gif" alt=":)" title="Smile" /> Awesome idea.</div>

I was thinking about this post last night and I'm definitely with you guys that something has to be done.  Ideally I wanted players to sell consumables, but you  are right that there isn't much point, since the gold you get for selling them would really only be useful for buying more consumables...so why not just keep the consumables you make?  Then, the only people who get to use consumables are the ones that own the geosids.  There's no reason to distribute them for gold because gold can't be used for anything.<br /><br /><br />I think I have a solution.  I'm going to talk it over with my brother to make sure it's not too crazy, but I have something in mind that would make it very useful.</div>

				<div class="content">Lol, it is a tricky one to think of something new and inventive instead of being like all the other games, can't wait to see what you have in mind Karl, a lot of your ideas have been pretty cool and interesting.</div>
