				<div class="content">Well, i KNOW every high lvl above 25, is wondering this, why doesnt hard liches and semi hard liches give as good exp as clearing trolls??? or better, we are afterall high lvls, and the risk of grinding there should be higher lvl gear AND higher exp.<br /><br />im sure some agree with this statement, atm i feel theres a clash between highlvls and low lvls about who gets to grind where and how and how fast.<br /><br />thinking 70 exp is much for trolls, then hard liches should be around like 180 or something, just saying that, and semi hard liches around 140.<br /><br />this way we would have high lvls grinding a isle like hunting ground, and low lvls grinding trolls.</div>

				<div class="content">I would agree that this exp is sorta messed up at the moment. At the higher levels you get the same exp from hard/easy liches as you do from trolls. So its like why fight the fewer harder mobs, when you can just fight a plethora of easier mobs almost twice as fast. That's why the higher mobs need to have a higher exp gain. I hope that this has already been taken into account and will be fixed in the next big content patch. I don't want to see me fight trolls again to level past 35, it's so boring.</div>

				<div class="content">It also causes problems when lower levels try to hunt somewhere, but someone who is a much higher level, and so much faster and efficient, clears the areas he's attempting to level in. <img src="images/smilies/icon_sad.gif" alt=":(" title="Sad" /></div>

				<div class="content">Which causes a problem for the higher level, because the much lower levels begs to party then you decide to and then they are slow and you have to wait for them to catch up a 100 times just cause party xp is great</div>
