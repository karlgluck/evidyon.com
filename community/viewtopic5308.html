				<div class="content">Excuse for what? A person who is called a bum usually doesn't work... I work. <br />You're insight into my girlfriend less life is quite wrong, as I actually do have one. Nice try though <img src="images/smilies/icon_smile.gif" alt=":)" title="Smile" /><br />As for no life, what is life referring to? Hanging with friends? I do that every weekend and sometimes weekdays but usually that's a no go, since we all work. Is working a life? <br /><br />Anyways, remove the tampon from your bum and grow up.
