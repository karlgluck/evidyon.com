				<div class="content">Hey everyone, I just wanted to see how this project was coming.  I heard that the beta was supposed to be out soon and I'd sure like to give it a shot.  Any idea on when it'll be out and if I'd be able to get in on the action?<br />Apparently most of the forum is private and it doesn't look like there's any activity to me so I'm kind of in the dark here.  Anyways, just wanted to see how the game was coming along, thanks.</div>

				<div class="content">Hi There There,<br /><br />Things are coming along great.  We're in a &quot;closed&quot; Alpha right now (I'm sure Karl will be happy to add you to the testers list), and are swift approaching the open Beta.<br /><br />Sorry about the sorry state of the boards:  they certainly need to be cleaned up, but we've been putting that off until Beta.</div>

				<div class="content">And those who want to know if the &quot;testing&quot; is going around alright just check it out.<br />Testing is going very well, Karl is doing a good job and it's safe to say that if Karl keeps it up the servers of Evidyon Beta will be flooded with Ex Xen players.<br /><br /><br /><img src="../../img147.imageshack.us/img147/8792/20090307141227.jpg" alt="Image" /></div>
