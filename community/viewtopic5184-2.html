				<div class="content">I was playing with Corsix today, we tried some more pvp. He is level 30, wouldn't give his secret stat recipe. I'm level 35 307 armor and 629 hp (I was wearing a spectral shield). With spectral kopeshes he could kill me in under 2 seconds. Now you might think this is normal for such a fast paced game such as Evidyon or Xenimus, but I'm a mage with a large amount of intelligence. Correct me if I'm wrong, one of the perks for going with less hp is getting more damage. I didn't feel the fight was fair because In those two seconds I might get 2 or 3 beams in, each doing 200ish damage (as corsix said). If he is constantly hitting me, then he is always getting his hp back, WHILE ATTACKING. All I can do is run and maybe beam him every few transes, also due to the fact that healing costs 1/3rd of my mp and beam costs 1/4-1/5 mp (waiting for it to regen is out of the question, I must use blue potions) So: while transing, using blue potions, using red potions, I have very little time to hit my hotkey and target with my beam. And if he's attack running after every trans and is constantly hitting me, 200 dmg every once in a while just get immidiatly stolen back. I would've liked to get a video of this and would have posted, but when I got back on from downloading fraps Corsix was gone, I'll edit post and add a.s.a.p. My suggestion is either lower lifestealing, or lower spell/potion cooldown, or lower warrior dps. I'd like to say this isn't a bias post: as I have a level 23 warrior, who when he was lvl 21 could take down mages that were 30+. <img src="images/smilies/icon_rolleyes.gif" alt=":roll:" title="Rolling Eyes" /> <br />Comments/Constructive Criticism please.</div>

				<div class="content">Thus the importance of constitution, you can stand and deal more hits, and agility to do more hits, therefore more damage.  I don't have this problem with pvp on my balanced adept with high int. No wisdom.<br /><br />I have been able to kill mages easily on my warrior because of these inconsiderate builds.  Though there is definitely a problem with mage damage, Fearon was barely hurting me when we pvp'd today, though had he had enough HP to get two beams in before transing I might have had to hit my med key today, even if he had to sacrifice a little damage. btw I was 27 and fearon was 30+<br /><br />Mage damage does need to be adjusted I agree, but it's not as off as you make it seem. And so does meelee, If I have an opponent I NEVER have to worry about mp because of MP steal.  I have 10 int and 10 wis. my MP is only 87.  but I can spin an opponent all day long and still have full MP, this would probably be drastically different if I had the next tier spin, but I don't, and don't even know if there is a next tier yet.  Whirlwind pwns enough.<br /><br />The fact that I instantly heal is great when leveling, but getting the same rate from other players is not good.<br /><br />My recommendations<br /><br /> <img src="images/smilies/icon_exclaim.gif" alt=":!:" title="Exclamation" /> Have steal reductions based on armour, so that you cannot steal as much HP and MP from somebody fully equiped in good gear<br /><br /> <img src="images/smilies/icon_exclaim.gif" alt=":!:" title="Exclamation" /> Adjust Mage dmg a lil bit after you've reviewed the balance numbers<br /><br /> <img src="images/smilies/icon_exclaim.gif" alt=":!:" title="Exclamation" /> Watch and enjoy as I slam down on these mages who don't worry about cons and agil<br /><br /> <img src="images/smilies/icon_exclaim.gif" alt=":!:" title="Exclamation" /> Screw me over somehow on having no wis, see idea one<br /><br />Editted to make sense, a second time because I meant wis, not int.</div>

In my defence: I didn't put any points in cons (well I did put 1) because I needed intel to get anywhere close to pvp dmg standards (vs warriors mostly). <img src="images/smilies/icon_neutral.gif" alt=":|" title="Neutral" /></div>

				<div class="content">Fixed it, and yes it does, it's called DPS. I think that beam has been underpowered because of trans advantage, but I'm pretty sure that trans doesn't have so much of an advantage, especially if you have a high agil fighter. I'd like to see a mage with agility in order to see if being able to deal a few more hit adds some more balance, but I agree that it should be tweaked.<br /><br />One thing that I think you are failing to realize is that a lot of the points being dedicated to int are hardly doing anything, (remember every point has less of an effect than the one before it, though the steepness of the reduction is reduced as you gain higher levels).  Corsix and I hit in the same range of dmg even though he is 5-7 levels higher than I am and wearing better weapons, but he is able to do more damage per second because he hits about three times to my one, probably more (I wasn't counting)<br /><br />When I (finally) added 1 point to my agility at level 26, It made an instantaneously noticable increase to my dps.  WIthout having taken time to do the measurements, I'd estimate 15-20 percent, whereas I'd estimate the difference made by increasing strength from 34-35 to be less than 2%.  That is a  700% or more difference in DPS increase.</div>
