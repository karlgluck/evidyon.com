				<div class="content">Idk when this idea popped into my head, but here it is..<br /><br />The only way I can explain it is the when in the old cartoons where someone would throw a black hole onto the ground/on a wall they would jump into it and be somewhere else..<br /><br />Well I thought it would be pretty cool to have a teleport like that.. Not just simply a black hole, add some nice special effects with it of course ;P<br /><br />Just thought having more then just the simple door couldn't hurt.. Variation is the key in most RPG's</div>

				<div class="content">i always loved the nightcrawler from x-mens teleportation, black smoke from original spot and on the port spot.<br />with a little smoke on the spot if you are a smart player you could track down the player whom had teleported before you but you would have to be fast.<br /><br />it would be like tracking down an enemy based on his own magic side effects.</div>

Either the door, the black hole, maybe others if you can come up with some other special effects ;D<br /><br /><br /><blockquote><div><cite>marzuku wrote:</cite>i always loved the nightcrawler from x-mens teleportation, black smoke from original spot and on the port spot.<br />with a little smoke on the spot if you are a smart player you could track down the player whom had teleported before you but you would have to be fast.<br /><br />it would be like tracking down an enemy based on his own magic side effects.</div></blockquote><br /><br />Ahha I &lt;3 &lt;3 &lt;3 that idea so so so much  <img src="images/smilies/icon_mrgreen.gif" alt=":mrgreen:" title="Mr. Green" />  <img src="images/smilies/icon_mrgreen.gif" alt=":mrgreen:" title="Mr. Green" />  <img src="images/smilies/icon_mrgreen.gif" alt=":mrgreen:" title="Mr. Green" />  <img src="images/smilies/icon_mrgreen.gif" alt=":mrgreen:" title="Mr. Green" /> <br /><br /><br />All I'm saying is that having different kinds of Special Effects or layouts for spells is a good idea..<br /><br />Like changing beams color.. Maybe even the Egg<br /><br />But either way I would love to see different versions of the spells..</div>

				<div class="content">Personally, i agree that changing the way the spells look would be awesome, but as of right now beam kinda looks weird, the fact that its yellow and comes out of the genital area...i mean...its pretty self explanatory, and about egg i think that it would be nice to keep that basic concept but to beef it up and make it look awesome. i was trying to think of another way to make egg look, but i drew a blank.</div>

The kind of Fiery/Glow look is pretty cool looking, I don't think Evidyon needs to go with the same spell build.. I think you can still make it feel like Xen, and still add some neat stuff/make it look better..</div>
