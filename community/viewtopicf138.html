				<div class="content">Hi I don't post here very often but I am currently trying to build my own diablo/xenimus like game. Anyways, I'll get to the point now. The reason why xenimus is choppy is because when your character is moving and the game has to load a new set of tiles it is not lining the viewing area up correctly during a new tile load. For instance say your character is moving upwards then when the game needs to load a new set of tiles it draws them all too far upwards. This makes a jerk effect happen. With the same senario if it draws it too far downwards it make a leaping effect happen. It extremely hard to get it perfectly lined up. I could not get mine perfect it leaps too. Alternatively, I could have had it jerk but could not get it perfect. I choosing the leaping effect cause its just a little bit harder to notice. Correct me if I'm wrong but thats what I noticed in my game anyways.</div>

				<div class="content">Hey Liggy,
<br />
<br />I'm not sure if your post is a question...?  But you might want to check your math on the tile-loading algorithm; it sounds like a float is being rounded off and giving you that issue.  Try using doubles instead of floats or pre-caching tiles (if load-time is your problem).  I haven't run into a problem with choppiness.</div>

				<div class="content">Not really a question I just wanted comments or maybe just to see if someone would reply. Xenimus to me looks choppy maybe its just my computer. Load time is not an issue and I'm using int's. Did you mean using doubles as tile positioning points? Because I wasn't aware that would work.</div>
