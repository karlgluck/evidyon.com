				<div class="content">I was watching the video again and I had an idea.<br />It's hard to tell the radius of some spells and determine if an npc is taking damage from them.<br />I was thinking maybe some visual alert to let the player know that the npc is in fact getting hit.<br />Something similiar to the blood aproach could be used, but instead of blood a white star or something to that effect.</div>

A DAMAGE BAR. like.... when you hit a monster. the Damaged hp shows above the monsters head. or a HP bar. Either one would work nicely haha <img src="images/smilies/icon_wink.gif" alt=";)" title="Wink" /><br /><br /><br />*Continues to wait for release* =)</div>

				<div class="content">yeah my first thought was an hp bar above npcs heads that shrinks like the players hp bar<br />this would help tons because u could know exactly what combination of spells to use to kill each monster if u are hunting the same npc for awhile<br />(like one stronger spell + one weaker spell would kill them as opposed to casting two stronger spells and wasting mana)</div>

				<div class="content">I like in games when you get a &quot;XX!&quot; above the monsters' heads, XX being the damage.<br /><br />It helps you in several ways.<br />1.) You know you hit the target.<br />2.) You get to know how often you do critical hits.<br />3.) You get to see your damage as you change your gear.<br /><br />It would be nice if this game had a system like that.<br /><br />Here's just one example:<br /><!-- m --><a class="postlink" href="http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dWeQnWVsQ3o">http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dWeQnWVsQ3o</a><!-- m --><br /><br />First game that came to mind.</div>

				<div class="content">I'm sorry to tromp on ideas, but seeing the HP of monsters is one that I'm going to have to be firm about. This will not be in the game for several reasons:<ul><li>It removes the element of mystery from monsters.  If I were to spawn a super-troll (like the bugged monsters ones of Xenimus) you'd instantly be able to know it, and this would remove such surprises from the game</li><li>The more knowledge you have to remember, the more you become a part of the world instead of just a player--this is how the &quot;oldschool&quot; player is created.  Those who are respected for being advanced game players do so because of their skill and knowledge collected over time.  The more knowledge that is put in the world (world map, monster HP, damage values) the less distinction there is.</li><li>Showing more stuff on the screen requires more bandwidth.  At this point, bandwidth is so low (only about 16 kbps with 128 characters moving simultaneously in a single area) that I should be able to get a HUGE number of players in a much bigger world.  Adding more data always increases bandwidth  cost, and I'd like to use that bandwidth for more interesting things--spell effects, animations, more players, more monsters, more items, etc.</li></ul><br />That said, there definitely needs to be some kind of ability to see whether or not you hit your target with a spell or ability.  I haven't added it to every one of my spells yet, but I'll work something up.</div>
