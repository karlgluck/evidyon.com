				<div class="content">Registration is now by account activation only because the number of spam bots was just getting unbearable.  I get a bunch of new registrations every day, most of which are spam, so to be sure YOU as a real person get activated, be sure you:<ul><li>Make a user-name that is sensible.  Make it something I can recognize or something that looks human.  rjwpodn4999 is NOT a user name I will activate--you'll just be ignored.</li><li>DONT fill out your whole profile!  Spammers fill their profiles with precreated junk and links.</li><li>If you've followed the above and want to be extra cool, put &quot;hey karl activate me&quot; in your occupation.</li></ul><br />I know this is a pain in the bum, and I'm sorry it's come to this.  We'll be getting new forums at a later date.</div>
