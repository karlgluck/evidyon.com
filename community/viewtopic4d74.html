				<div class="content">The sickle looks really cool--but is there any chance you can make it use the same texture as some other models so I don't have to package yet another texture?<br /><br /><br />This might be asking a lot, but would it be possible to have one texture that can be used to a number of basic weapons?  That way, I could make different versions of those weapons fairly easily--a whole fire set, for example, could be accomplished by tinging the single texture red.</div>

				<div class="content">yeah, i can do that pretty easily.  I'll put together a 512x512 file with maybe 8 or so textures on it that can be utilized by most if not all of the models.  I'll see how well i can compact it all.</div>

				<div class="content">Asked my wife what type of weapon to draw, and since we're both from Hawai'i she said I should model up one of the typical Hawaiian weapons of old.  This is typically a wooden club with shark teeth attached to the sides.  White didn't look very good for the &quot;teeth&quot; so I used the &quot;dark metal&quot; texture I previously made for the sickle.  Original image I based it off of is here: <img src="../../www.bishopmuseum.org/exhibits/pastExhibits/1997/treasures/large_images/WEAPON.html" alt="Image" /><br /><img src="../../i2.photobucket.com/albums/y6/DocHolliday511/sharktooth.jpg" alt="Image" /></div>

				<div class="content">Yikes!  That's a scary-looking club!<br /><br />For your model, a couple things bother me (though admittedly this is <span style="font-style: italic">not</span> something of which I know anything, so feel free to disregard ...):<br />1.  The wood oval seems too wide--could those be brought closer together (less space between the sides) to make the weapon more compact/believable/threatening?<br />2.  The wood texture itself isn't convincing me.  The lines run in strange ways (down the length of the club instead of horizontally) and the material doesn't look dark enough to me.  Now that's a texture thing, so limited resources &amp;c. probably come in to play, but ...<br /><br />Looking great!</div>

I do really like them <img src="images/smilies/icon_smile.gif" alt=":)" title="Smile" /><br /><br />I agree with Joe about the wood on the Hawaiian weapon, but it's not a huge deal.  What is this thing called anyway?</div>

				<div class="content">Lei O Mano Puka is what this particular one is called.  Lei = wreath, or some main backing that the individual pieces go on.  O = just like &quot;of&quot;. Mano = shark.  Puka = hole, because of the hole in the middle.<br /><br />Updated the texture as well as the orientation of the wood grain.  Maybe it's better, maybe not.</div>

				<div class="content">My brother now points out to me that lengthwise is the correct way for the grain to run:  wood breaks along the grain, and the club would snap if the grain ran horizontally.  I was looking at the picture you provided, but that's probably not the grain anyway, but carving on top of the grain.<br /><br />But now that we've heard arguments both ways, I guess the only correct solution would be whatever looks good.  New texture, vertical grain, horizontal grain.  So it's up to you.</div>

				<div class="content">The thing is, you can't really have a detailed texture for each individual weapon.
