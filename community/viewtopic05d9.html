				<div class="content">First:  I just uploaded a quick feature-addition.  <span style="font-weight: bold">Right-clicking will now re-cast the last targeted spell you used</span>.  For example, if you teleport then right-click, it will cast teleport again.  This does not work for items or for spells where you don't have to pick a target.  Enjoy, button-mashers =)<br /><br />Second:  <span style="font-weight: bold">recruit more players</span>!  Playing is always more fun with a bigger crowd.  I'd love to see some new faces around here--so much so that the next time I see more than 20 players online, everyone will get a Holy Figurine.  More than 30?  Expect something even better!<br /><br />Here are some things you could try:<br /> - If you have cool screenshots, upload them to tinypic or some other service and show them to your friends or post them on appropriate forums<br /> - Upload videos of Evidyon to YouTube &amp; share them<br /> - Add Evidyon to your signature on other forums<br /> - Make an Evidyon T-shirt  <img src="images/smilies/icon_lol.gif" alt=":lol:" title="Laughing" /> <br /> - Play Evidyon in public places and show it off!  (I've had people come ask me what I was playing in earlier versions of the game)<br /> - Make a website on a free server that shows off your screenshots, videos, avatar stories, etc.<br /> - Link to <a href="http://www.evidyon.com/" class="postlink">evidyon.com</a>!<br /><br />By doing some of these things, you can help make Evidyon a really great game that will just keep growing!<br /><br />If you have any other ideas, post 'em here.<br /><br /><br />~Karl<br /><br />Edit 1:  The Earthen Emblem award went out last night!  Congrats everyone, check the screenshots on the main website for pictures!</div>

Or we can get more people to level up and go deeper into the dungeon.</div>

				<div class="content">Hey the more people we get, the more leveling parties we can have = the easier it becomes.  But yeah I'd at least suggest raising the spawn rate. <img src="images/smilies/icon_biggrin.gif" alt=":D" title="Very Happy" /></div>

				<div class="content">Here is an easy one.<br />I know it is lame now a days but, how about a Facebook group.<br />Create a facebook group named Evidyon or something of the likings, then anyone can post screenshots <br />or link videos to their profile page.<br />It is a simple idea, have a starting group of us alpha and beta testers join the group and then the rest will be up to Facebook.<br />When you join a group, it is relayed in the message feed so that all your Facebook friends will see it and hopefully be interested if we had a sweet picture to lure them in.  Then maybe a couple of your friends will join the group and say 1 or 2 of them would start to be active in the game, since now beta is completly a different game, with all the new items and abilities it is easier to lure new players and get them addicted.  Then your friends friends will see the message feed and hopefully be interested, then it goes on from there.<br />It is kind of like a mass, almost instant, chain letter.<br /><br /> <img src="images/smilies/icon_cool.gif" alt="8)" title="Cool" /> Ohh, I like Karl's idea of an Evidyon t-shirt.  How about something not too flashy, say &quot;Project Volucris&quot; on the front of the shirt in a smaller size font in the upper left hand (over the wearers heart) of the shirt.  Then the back would have the wallpaper at Evidyon.com but, just the inner circle part.</div>

If you put a quarter on your computer screen (and you have a 21&quot; monitor...), that's about the size of the current main map relative to what is coming =)</div>
