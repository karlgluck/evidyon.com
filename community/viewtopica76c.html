				<div class="content">Quite the hot movie. Not historically correct of course, but what can we expect, it's based off of the graphic novel which was obviously off of the facts. Good movie overall, looks great. Battle scenes are excellent in particular but what else would you be going to see this movie for anyway?
<br />
<br />Go see this movie.</div>

				<div class="content">I've heard mixed things about this film, but I want to see it for three reasons:
<br /><ul>*I liked <span style="font-style: italic">Sin City</span> a lot.<br />*I studied ancient Greek culture in several of my classes last semester, and I enjoyed it a lot<br />*In the first trailers, every line of dialogue was taken from historical accounts or legends of the battle.</ul></div>

				<div class="content">Just don't expect deep plot character development. Violence is the name of the game... lots of it. I found myself laughing during some of the scenes at just the sheer brute force of some of the blows that were acted out. Very good acting for sure and none of the fighting seemed fake. Well.. I guess that's not the right way to put it. Lets go with the acting made the superheroic strength of the spartans seem realistic.</div>
