				<h3>Minor Issues List</h3>

				<div class="content">I know this alpha is to work out the big bugs first, but it can't hurt to make a minor issues list to be worked on.<br /><br />1. In the login screen after typing account number, tab should move to the password screen.<br />2. After typing in your password, enter should log you in to the world.<br />3. On the character creation screen, the button says create character and enter world, but it returns you to the character select screen instead of logging that character in.<br />4. If you type an invalid account number or password and hit enter world, it does not inform you that either is invalid it just does nothing.<br />5. Pressing escape or pressing the button you used to open the dialog should also exit it. (example: pressing k or escape should exit you out of the keys dialog.<br />6. Exiting to the character select screen from in the game needs a dialog. (are you sure you want to log off this character? yes | no)<br />7. The radio buttons when selecting items or spells seem reversed to me. When an item is not selected the circle is filled with black and when they're not selected they're white. is it just me or does this seem backwards?<br />8. Character Select and Create screens need a matching gui to the rest of the game.<br />9. Male gnomes are colored but females are not.<br />10. Title Bar still says &quot;Project Volucris&quot; =)<br />11. Scrolling with mouse scroll button in menus that have a scroll bar<br /><br />more to come</div>

				<div class="content">contributing to the list:<br /><br />- human female model doesn't show up or animate properly<br />- water is sometimes blue and sometimes it is clear so the ground under it is seen<br />- character stops responding randomly when there are many monsters on the screen<br />- it seems like armor doesn't have any effect<br />- monsters have no pathfinding, they get stuck behind trees<br />- there is no way to clear key bindings. If I want to change the binding of a spell, if the new spell is under the old spell, I can bind the same key to the new spell and if I close and reopen the bindings screen, it will update and clear the old spell. However, this does not work for spells above the previous spell that you want to set the key for; the new binding will disappear while the old one remains after closing and reopening the bindings screen.<br />- small issue, not game related, mainly ease-of install: the installer complains that the old version is still installed, must remove manually.<br />- camera is jumpy when colliding and quickly changing direction. Character appears to move into obstacle, and then reappears outside the obstacle when colliding. Collision causes full stop no matter which angle you collide at. I suggest implementing sliding collisions. It may help with the monsters getting stuck too, although it seems more likely that they spawned on top of each other and the collision handler isn't allowing them to move. I assume you are handling collisions by having the objects move back to their original positions. This will cause the monsters getting stuck glitch if the original position is still in a state of collision, as they will never be able to separate.</div>

Yes the collisions suck right now; I haven't really thought about them.  However, the camera is jumpy because position smoothing is currently disabled due to lag causing weird effects.  I'm working on a fix for that after I get more screens up and running.<br /><br /><br /><blockquote><div><cite>Ratiotile wrote:</cite>- human female model doesn't show up or animate properly</div></blockquote><br />This one is really weird; the human female is the exact same model as all of the other female models, so I'm not sure what's causing this problem only with the human one.<br /><br /><blockquote><div><cite>Ratiotile wrote:</cite>- water is sometimes blue and sometimes it is clear so the ground under it is seen</div></blockquote><br />This is a fog issue.  I don't think fog likes to play with transparent objects very nicely.<br /><br /><blockquote><div><cite>Ratiotile wrote:</cite>- character stops responding randomly when there are many monsters on the screen</div></blockquote><br />collision bug, I think.<br /><br /><blockquote><div><cite>Ratiotile wrote:</cite>- monsters have no pathfinding, they get stuck behind trees</div></blockquote><br />Will be fixed with the collision bug<br /><br /><blockquote><div><cite>Ratiotile wrote:</cite>- there is no way to clear key bindings.

				<div class="content">These 2 may not be bugs, but I found them odd<br /><br />- When you die, and Cleavers are on the screen, they do some sort of shuffle.<br />- Text can be seen through the inventory screen, and other screens.<br /><br />These are almost certainly bugs<br /><br />- When you hit Enter, an underscore pops up so signify that you are typing. If you type nothing and try to hit Enter again to get rid of it, you must hit Enter 3 times total for it to go away.<br /><br />- As a Male Human Warlock, the spell &quot;pirinand&quot; hurts me the second I press the key for it. There's no chance for me to target something else. The upgraded version of this spell (i don't remember the name), works properly.</div>

				<div class="content">Some minor bugs ive found:<br /><br />-Walking bug:<br />when you cast spells or just dont do anything special at all, your char suddenly starts to run off in a straight line. prob the collide bug or autowalk thingy.<br />-Stat Points: <br />Chars that was over lvl 9 (i guess) only got 8 stat points even tho they should have recieved alot more due to their lvl (f.ex: lvl 16 only got 8 stat points when stat screen was implented)<br />-Monster spawn points:<br />Monsters spawn on top of eachother, not able to move without 1 of them dieng first<br />-Monster aoe spells (and bows):<br />They hit all other mobs in the range, not only players. will draw agro from you.<br />-Share exp with monster:<br />When monsters get hit by arrows/aoe spells sometimes they dont give as much exp as they would to the player that kills them (if you did 100% dmg to a mob u get all exp, but if an aoe/arrow hit them they often dont give that same amount)<br />-infinite hp bug:<br />If you are dead and press the &quot;x&quot; button on the program (to quit) you will respawn at the same spot with 0 hp but still &quot;alive&quot;<br />-+Hp/mp items taken on/off:<br />Hp/Mp bar will not reset when you equip/unequip items with these stats. this can give you stuff like 440/120 mp and also gives an extra long bar indicating it.</div>
