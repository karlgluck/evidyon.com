				<div class="content">Hey, that music sounds really great. The only objections that I have- I think that town music should be slightly more vigorous (not action music, but something with slighty more momentum). I disapprove of the Xenimus ghost-towns, where that would fit very well. If we dont have the same music for every town, or parts of the town, we could put that as the music for inside houses and/or graveyards? Thats just my two cents, what do you guys think?</div>

				<div class="content">hey that sounds great. i was hoping Karl would beable to add different music for different towns.
<br />
<br />for the main town have a loud and proud sound.
<br />theres a town in a desert setting
<br />theres a town in a snowy setting
<br />theres a town near the ocean
<br />theres a town in the mountains
<br />theres a town in the forest
<br />
<br />
<br />i think that song sounds a lil slow and sad... ideal for the Village of Heartwood, the abanonded village of the forest</div>

				<div class="content">Different music for different towns can definitely happen.  I'm adding to the editor something called &quot;music regions&quot; where you can specify exactly which musical score you want to play when the player is in a certain area.  This means you can even have specific music for single houses if you wanted <img src="images/smilies/icon_wink.gif" alt=";)" title="Wink" />
<br />
<br />Also, the final music in the game will likely be synthesized on FruityLoops or the like, unless you can get a professional-quality recording so that there isn't so much static and the tempo is consistent.  Not to say your music isn't good--I love the tune!--but the arhythmic riffs throws off the fluidity of the piece.</div>

				<div class="content">i don't understand what you mean about the synthesizing thing, but i just got recording equipment for christmas so ill see what i can do about professional quality. and ill put down a metronome so when i play im not off at all=)</div>

				<div class="content">Synthesized, as in what you write is taken by a composer (we have a few around on the boards) and put into music software so that other instruments, such as percussion, piano, etc. can be added.  Then the whole thing is &quot;synthesized&quot; (the music is generated by the software) and written to an MP3.  This way, the MP3 is flawless--no recording hiss or pops (even at max volume), no wrong notes, the tempo is always the same...etc.  It's almost the single way that music is made for games because of its quality and simplicity.  Don't worry about it for now, though--just keep writing <img src="images/smilies/icon_biggrin.gif" alt=":D" title="Very Happy" /></div>

				<div class="content">I'm learning my way through FL Studio (Fruity Loops) right now. I've put together some nice beats, and I'd be happy to try to synthesize some stuff. (The loops I've been making really do sound professional)</div>
