				<h3>What's going on with this update</h3>
				<div class="date"><img src="styles/prosilver/imageset/icon_post_target.gif" width="11" height="9" alt="Post" title="Post" />Posted: <strong>Sun Aug 23, 2009 5:47 pm</strong></div>

				<div class="content">First, I want to thank everyone for sticking with me and showing up last night for the first test of the new version.  There were obviously some issues that need to be resolved, and I will be coding all day tomorrow (I spent today recovering from lack of sleep over the last week and doing minor tweaks).<br /><br />Tonight, I am playing the game with a few friends here at my place to get everything in place for a re-launch of this version.  So far I have fixed:<br />- several crash bugs (I've played for an hour or so without problems)<br />- fixed geosids (their bonuses will now show up!)<br />- slowed monsters down, sped players up so that the game feels much more responsive<br />- repeatedly clicking on monsters to attack them doesn't cause your attacks to keep resetting<br />- AOE spells are fixed<br />- the launcher can now update your files<br />- DOT spells will now work correctly on any target<br /><br />So here's my plan:  I'll release a new version with all the fixes tonight.  You'll need to re-download the installer.<br /><br />Because we are still trying to figure out how to balance everything, make sure the game is stable and make it more fun (!!) we need you guys to help us test.<br /><br />To this end, we will be doing reset-tests of the game until next week.  Each day expect to log in to a completely wiped server with fixes based on your feedback from the previous version.  You can get in, play, test things out and let me know what needs to be fixed here on the forum.  Once Pre-Beta starts, we will start the &quot;official&quot; version where you get to keep your characters, and we will start adding content/maps/spells/etc and increasing the level cap as fast as we can.<br /><br />Great to hear that everyone had a good time!</div>

				<div class="content">Something I encountered while testing last night:<br />Firefox had stashed a copy of the installer somewhere, so even after I uninstalled and deleted all the files (including the installer), when I went to download the new installer, Firefox just grabbed the copy it had on hand (same link, same file name, same file, right?) and plunked it down in my download folder:  20 MB, instantly!  But the installer was the old one and had all the old problems ...<br /><br />The way you can tell the difference:  the latest installer has the correct directory for default install (C:\Program Files\Evidyon instead of C:\Program Files\Common Files\Evidyon).<br /><br />I finally got it to work by downloading with a different browser.</div>

				<div class="content">Playing it right now (well, yeah untill the server crashed lol), and it's alot of fun. I really dig the more vibrant world and the funky spells.<br /><br />The only thing i'm not really digging is the graphics, i.e. textures (Effects and models are great). Things are looking too &quot;low-res&quot; and everything could use a bit less contrast together with some more brightness. Also something like anti-aliasing would help alot.<br /><br />Besides that, two thumbs up. :]</div>
