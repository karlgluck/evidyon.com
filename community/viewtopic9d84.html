				<div class="content">is it true that the merchant doesnt have anything? and dont we own money or such? or just the green number in the bottom. because the healing spells consumes alot of it, for a lvl 5 to hunt the greenlongfingered guys:P<br /><br />i realy like the game so far, and i hope you will fix the graphic issue on window vista, because it bugs the hell out of me:P<br />also i think you need more graphs for the items.<br /><br />i saw they were pixels (like paint images) so maybe we (the community) can submit some designs for a small ingame price or something? make it like a contest, and you would only pick those you like <img src="images/smilies/icon_smile.gif" alt=":)" title="Smile" /><br /><br />i dunno just brainstorming here. when does the update come?</div>

				<div class="content">The merchant on the square offers storage, not items for sale.<br />See the Basic Instructions:  <!-- l --><a class="postlink-local" href="http://www.unseenstudios.com/community/viewtopic.php?f=25&amp;t=1374#p8864">viewtopic.php?f=25&amp;t=1374#p8864</a><!-- l --><br /><br />The Vista graphical bug is certainly very irritating, but it is an understandably low priority.  It's on the list and will hopefully be fixed before Beta.<br /><br />As for our current poverty of graphics, it is a problem, but again, a secondary one.  We are always happy to include player-submitted content, particularly graphical content.  I believe we have most of our item models (and the ground graphics) from various players.  Any time you have something you think would fit in-game or be an improvement on the current model or graphic, just post it on the forums and we'll see if we can use it.<br /><br />I haven't talked to Karl in a couple days so I'm not sure when today's update will be released, but you can expect it some time this evening.</div>

				<div class="content">All stats were reset to 10 because there's a new equation governing stats and it now matters in what order you add points.  Unfortunately, the mechanism for reassigning points doesn't seem to be working  <img src="images/smilies/icon_rolleyes.gif" alt=":roll:" title="Rolling Eyes" /> , so they're all stuck at 10 until Karl can fix that.<br /><br />The speed is crazy, I know.  I've noted it for Karl, hopefully to be fixed in the next update (we hope to have a mini-update to correct these critical issues in the next couple days).<br /><br />Speaking of all this, I need to create a new thread for this update ...</div>
