				<div class="content">While old xenimus only had a few tiers of items, I think we can improve this by making Lots of tiers of items with a great deal of variety. This way people dont have to use that old fire mace for 6 levels in a row before they can realistically upgrade. 
<br />
<br />Also , this is a big one.
<br />
<br />NO MORE LEVEL CAPS!
<br />With the exception of a few legendary, very rare, items, no items should have level caps. If that idiot wants to put a mystic bow on his level 3 thief, let him. We can point and laugh when he is PKed for it. (and since we wont have magic bags or the like, this is possible)</div>

				<div class="content">I like the idea of magic bags when they first first first came out.
<br />They were called hidden bag of holding, and when you died it dropped on the ground, and you would have to return to the spot where you died to pick it up(along with all of your stuff in it), and no one else could see it.</div>

				<div class="content">The magic bag makes the game too secure. are we not trying to capture the original feel of xenimus? When you die you should drop everything. (this will be offset by a more liberal drop)</div>

<br />
<br />on that note: LSAs should exist. But they should be more expensive. They should never fail. (that sucks)</div>

				<div class="content">I think a wider selection of weapons would be a good thing, things like maybe &quot;Fire Axe, Dragon Axe, Dragon Halberd&quot; 
<br />I do realize that this project is into creating the old school feel but I just like throwing ideas out there to see what people have to say
<br />
<br />How about this, the weapons have an amount of weight, and depending on this weight and a combination of str and agil, would have an effect on how fast the weapon could be swung. You could have weapons that did minor damage but could be swung quickly, weapons that were slower but did greater damage, and then a weapon in the middle that did average damage with an average swing pace (for those who like balance)</div>

				<div class="author">by <strong>Karl G.</strong></div>
				<div class="content">Luckily, scripts are so much different from programming, once you get the hang of them they're mostly just like filling out a form.  For example, the first two lines of an item script might go like:
<br />
<br />ITEM_NAME = &quot;item display name&quot;
<br />ITEM_TYPE = sword, shield, twohanded, helmet, ring, amulet, armor, ... etc
<br />...
<br />
<br />so:
<br />
<br />ITEM_NAME = &quot;sword of the dead&quot;
<br />ITEM_TYPE = sword
<br />...</div>
