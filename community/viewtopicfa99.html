				<div class="content">Okay! so I'm going to keep posting my concept drawings in this thread so they don't get scattered. <br /><br />These are just to stimulate creativity for those that can do the actual 3d portion. If something needs to be changed so be it. Thats why they are concept drawings.<br />I've got a lot of free time on my hands so expect to see more.<br /><br /><img src="../../i184.photobucket.com/albums/x41/alinktothepast_92/100_1506.jpg" alt="Image" /><br /><br /><img src="../../i184.photobucket.com/albums/x41/alinktothepast_92/100_1507.jpg" alt="Image" /></div>

				<div class="content">Hrm, the polygon count with the extra 4 &quot;ridges&quot; in the helmet is rather high.  With just the central ridge it isn't that bad.  here, check it out...<br />Still needs a better texture though!<br /><img src="../../i2.photobucket.com/albums/y6/DocHolliday511/mHelm.jpg" alt="Image" /></div>

				<div class="content">Actually come to think about it... I was looking at the Necromonger armor to give myself a basic starting point for the design.. so really the dark greys and what not that their armor is fashioned in would probably work best since I did use their armor as a reference. The colors you have it right now look good.. the textures just need to look smooth.</div>

				<div class="content">Okay... Here is a second armor set. I went ahead and gave them a little color but I have a lame set of color pencils so its nothing stellar.<br />This set was meant to give off that high gloss reflectiveness, almost like glass. A very clean look.<br /><br />Anyway... have fun modelers... again... if you want to tweak things that will make it look better... go for it.<br /><br /><img src="../../i184.photobucket.com/albums/x41/alinktothepast_92/100_1591.jpg" alt="Image" /></div>

				<div class="content">That's actually exactly what i was thinking.  Making at least the yellow aspect somewhat transparent.  I'm not 100% sure on the gray part, but I think I will make it a darker gray, still translucent, but not nearly so much as the yellow spikes/trim.</div>

				<div class="content">That would be badass to have a set of armor that was completely translucent. Would be even sweeter if it was affected by lighting elements.  <img src="images/smilies/icon_wink.gif" alt=":wink:" title="Wink" /> <br /><br />I can put some work into textures if you'd like.<br /><br />-Steve</div>

				<div class="content">I am done with the models themselves. I did some work on textures last night, and tried some things like burning and dodging a 3D feel to it.... but it  just didn't look right with it being transparent and whatnot.  I think I'll go ahead and create the texture, but without trying to create the 3D feel and see how that looks.  I realize that I should have done that in the first place, but whatever.... it was late and I had a few too many beers to really care.<br /><br />Will try and post the models during my lunch break.</div>

				<div class="content">Decided to take a small break from the armor.. and I didn't know where we stood exactly on entry level weapons. So I figured it would be a good idea draw up some sketches since the game will obviously need entry level weapons more than unique ones at this point in time.<br /><br /><img src="../../i184.photobucket.com/albums/x41/alinktothepast_92/100_1592.jpg" alt="Image" /><br /><img src="../../i184.photobucket.com/albums/x41/alinktothepast_92/100_1593.jpg" alt="Image" /></div>

				<div class="content">the only problem I see with them, is that don't seem realistic enough. the handles for warhammers and the like are way too thin. and would most likely bend like a straw if used. but that is my only quarrel with them. but they do look nice. Good job</div>

				<div class="content">They weren't about being realistic... For the most part you barely see the weapon handles on the characters. This is just a starting point for modelers to get an idea of shape and design. As for strength of material... I own several weapons... the strength of a weapon deals mainly with the way the steel is forged. You'd be amazed at how something thin can stand up to punishment. However I do see where your coming from.</div>
