				<div class="content">I believe the idea is to develop the game with the current models, textures etc, but only for testing. This could not be released because of legal issues.
<br />So, every model, texture, everything in the game would have to be created from scratch before the game could be released, hence why they need 3d modelers, coders, and content designers.</div>

				<div class="content">If there was a beta(actually more likely an alpha) it would most likely be closed to a limited number of testers, that way they can control who uses it and keep out people who could be a problem.</div>

				<div class="content">The game doesnt have to look all that pretty. Project Volucris is about GAMEPLAY. but graphics will probably end up being better than xenimus.
<br />As far as sound goes, Im a little bummed about not being able to use original xen sounds, but we can make VERY similar sounds.</div>

				<div class="content">Yeah I'm sad I can't just use Xen's content and change the game ...but there is a possibility available:  I *think* it might be possible to use Xenimus's content if I don't distribute the content itself, ie. require that Xenimus is installed before installing Volucris, and just &quot;snatching&quot; all of the content directly from the Xenimus directory.  There are a few problems with this approach, however:<ul><li>If EJ changes any of the models/model formats or file names, it screws up Volucris</li><li>JUpdates would have to occur every time EJ updates</li><li>If Volucris got popular, EJ would likely encrypt everything</li></ul>
<br />I might be able to offer a &quot;mirror&quot; download of Xenimus that I just...&quot;forget&quot;...to update that is compatible with Volucris, but still that gets into a legal gray area.  It's better to simply have custom content--the problem therein, however, lies in the fact that it is very difficult to create.
<br />
<br />I will upload some of EJ's models as .X files so you modelers can load them up and play with them.
<br />
<br />
<br />Also, to answer Vitriol's original question, no the game won't be called Volucris.  That's a &quot;beta&quot; name, like Longhorn was for Windows Vista.</div>
