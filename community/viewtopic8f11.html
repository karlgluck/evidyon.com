				<div class="content">i really enjoy doing quests, even back 4 years ago on xen i really looked forward to lvl 8
<br />you got to do bag quest and white pot quest.
<br />there should be quite a few quests, so it helps you along the way, this gives you more a reason to seek out dangerous dungeons and kill hard bosses, and possibly the oprotunity to own rare gear, also it takes your mind off lvling for a bit so the game does not become boring.
<br />
<br />i think every town person who is not a merchant should offer some type of quest, for gear/gold/exp.</div>

<br />
<br />hrm....quests do make the game better, but if we wanted to have even more fun we should put in lots of different raids for every 10 levels or so.</div>

				<div class="content">Yes quests are a must, some offering experience... some offering gold... a few rare ones that offered skill points or a stat point... quests help to create a story... as well as give purpose to the dungeons around the map besides for lvling</div>

				<div class="content">Yeah. And possibly not be like ej and make everything fun for lvls 25+. 
<br />Maybe some raids for like lvl 10's and stuff. They'll drop maybe lightning gear or something, and basically drop gear for the nearest level. Like level 20 raids drop mystic, ect. But they can also drop lesser gear too. I love this idea of raids. ^_^</div>

				<div class="content">it would be cool to have a new set of raids for evey 10 levels
<br />
<br />like levels 1-10 can go to one dungeon and then once they get level 11 they have to go to another raid spot til they hit level 21...ect, ect.</div>
