				<div class="content">ok so i got to playing with things and it seems like trans can be some what non-responsive sometimes. not to say that it doesn't work but more of a slow almonst sluggish response not sure if its just that i dont have the agility i need yet or what the deal is anyone got a high agil mage that can trans beam? also if u hit the create port button and then the end task key it doesnt stop it you from the port screen which means u cant cast untill you make a port.</div>

				<div class="content">Two problems:<br />1. Responsiveness:  Agility does affect cast speed.  It might be a problem with this, it might not be.  Can anybody else help here?<br /><br />2. Stop action with portal:  I haven't observed this simply because I never use the stop action key.  This is a problem.  In the meantime, use right-click, which cancels activated spells (although this too may not work with portal--I'm not sure).</div>

				<div class="content">well i think its the spell delay time or that's what it seems like i will try out the port right click thing. it really messed me up (like 100k penalty) i set the wrong key for it and couldnt figure out what i did lol</div>

				<div class="content">Adept magnus doesnt have a problem transbeaming me, he seems to have found out of it, though he finally fell into the pit.<br />but i have found transers to be unresponsive at quite many occations.<br /><br />think its easier if you increase the depth of what you can fall before you die, if you have a transer anyway you most likely wont die.. so im guessing its no biggy:)</div>

				<div class="content">You might also want to check there there just isn't lag going on. See if the response time for trans is the same with click/movement. I've had this issue every one in a while, I don't know if it's a problem on my end or the server's.</div>
