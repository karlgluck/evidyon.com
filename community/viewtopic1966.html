				<div class="content">Hey,<br /><br />It sometimes can be a pain when you are almost facing the correct direction to actually in theory &quot;hit&quot; the monster but in fact you are slightly not facing precisely enough to actually strike it which isn't annoying but sometimes a bit long winded when melee'ing for hours lol!<br /><br />What about if when a mob stikes the character something tells the server or something that you were hit in the &quot;Front&quot; or the &quot;Rear&quot;, this way any mobs that are told they hit you in the &quot;Front&quot; will be hit exactly back when you hit strike till it is dead, instead of having to re click and adjust slightly to actually hit a monster which was in theory practically facing your front hitting you.<br /><br />Don't know if that seams feasible!<br /><br /><br />Take Care<br />Richard</div>

				<div class="content">This is definitely doable.  However, I'm going to improve melee combat significantly in the future so I'd rather hold off on fixing this until I do.  For now I'll just up the spread at which strike can hit.<br /><br />Karl</div>

				<div class="content">thats fine <img src="./images/smilies/icon_biggrin.gif" alt=":D" title="Very Happy" /> I dont see a problem with making it spread really <img src="./images/smilies/icon_smile.gif" alt=":)" title="Smile" />, maybe if you do decide something about front and back, especially with melee pvp then, back attacks might be some kind of added bonus attack damage <img src="./images/smilies/icon_smile.gif" alt=":)" title="Smile" /><br /><br />Then theives who could potential conceal themselves in the shadows, would actually be feared alot more <img src="./images/smilies/icon_smile.gif" alt=":)" title="Smile" /><br /><br />Well thats what could be used from that but if you have ideas then go for it! <img src="./images/smilies/icon_biggrin.gif" alt=":D" title="Very Happy" /><br /><br />Cheers for spreading the radius man!<br /><br />Richard</div>

				<div class="content">Will the melee attacks be handled like in Xenimus? the system you have now is kind of awkward and I can imagine would be very hard to deal with in a PvP situation.</div>
