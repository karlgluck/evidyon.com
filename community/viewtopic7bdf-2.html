				<div class="content">I would love to level a Warrior, however, will Warriors ever have the option of Transing/Gassing?  If they don't, there is no way for them to reach the far east side of the map.  It's separated by water and we can't swim yet.  Also, if this characters gets stuck on landscape, my only option is to kill myself in order to be returned back normal play.   I've been collecting gear for my Warrior, but my Warrior is stuck in a piece of landscape and can't move free. A -stuck/-return command would be useful in this situation.<br /><br />Also, will we ever have the option to delete a character? I'd like to redo stats on my Warrior and keep his name.</div>
