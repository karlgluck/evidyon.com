				<div class="content">Same spell problem.<br />Also, non-responsive monsters showing up over spawn points.  Can't walk through them, but neither can I target them with a spell or kill them with a sword.<br /><br />Also, you can walk through walls.  This one's from the graveyard downstairs, but I was freely passing through the upstairs walls to kill skeletons and get the loot:  when a skeleton gets close to the wall, click to attack:  you can fight it, and then when it's dead just keep clicking and about half the time you'll walk right through.</div>

				<div class="content">I wondered about that.<br /><br />Also, three times yesterday the program crashed on me.  Possible causes:  (a) less likely, to do with leveling up--happened about the times I leveled, but I'm not certain; (b) more likely, to do with losing the server connection--my network is very jumpy, and I'll lose connection to the server for 20 seconds or so at a time in which my character is frozen and I can't see any monsters.  If these go on long enough, it seems to crash to program (though other times the program's just gone to the &quot;Stop Connecting&quot; screen).</div>

				<div class="content"><span style="font-weight: bold"><span style="text-decoration: underline">Version 2.4</span></span><br /><br />Character Creation:<br />*  One is able to create a character without allocating any stat points.<br />*  Character name checking is <span style="font-weight: bold">not</span> case sensitive, so I have both &quot;Alpha Male&quot; and &quot;alpha male.&quot;  With an all-caps font, of course, there's no way to tell these two apart in-game (even if caps are slightly larger, it's not noticeable).<br />*  If one tries a very long character name, when one clicks to continue, the program crashes.  Behavior:  a name 33 characters long will crash the game; 31 won't; 32 gets strange:  when one clicks to continue, the game freezes and shows the &quot;stop trying to connect&quot; screen; after a while one gets the log-in screen; if one exits from the &quot;stop trying to connect&quot; screen and immediately restarts the game, the same screen is shown for a little while before proceeding to the log-in screen; if one waits to restart the game, one doesn't have to wait.</div>

				<div class="content">*  Item descriptions don't refresh.<br />*  While scrolling through inventory, multiple item names will get highlighted and remain so.<br />*  Inventory strangeness:  it appears that I can add more items of a certain type than I'm supposed to be able to, but no benefit is gained from the extra items.  After Log-out/-in, items equipped are reduced to the limit, but it appears to be random which items are kept equipped and which ones revert to inventory.<br />*  Also, inventory order not saved on Log-out/-in.<br /><br />*  While running/walking in a certain direction, if I try to cast a projectile spell in a different direction, it won't work:  it goes along the path I'm moving.<br /><br />*  Phantom items appear to be on the ground, but (of course) can't be picked up.

Not sure if this works for player-dropped items (doesn't seem to).</div>
