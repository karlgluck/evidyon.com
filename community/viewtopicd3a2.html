				<div class="content">I'm working on a new tool right now that will be our final, complete solution for editing everything about PV.  It's so flexible, it will be able not only to edit maps, but also add new media, define races/classes, create action scripts (if we want), designate experience levels, and much more!  Not only that, it can currently generate specialized, compressed &quot;game packs&quot; using those resources to distribute to the client and server.  The days of writing script in the UDT language (see media.dat and maped.dat) to add new content will come to an end; not only that, the download will be much smaller and game content far easier to update.
<br />
<br />Pics coming soon.</div>

Hopefully everything continues smoothly.  I'll post screenshots when something more *visually* interesting is finished.  Right now I've got the underlying groundwork-code functioning (I wrote about 6000 lines in 18 files during the last two days!) and am adding the code-layer that uses that groundwork.</div>

<br />Also, I don't know what the encoding is on this video but I'll try uploading it anyway.  I'm going to make a better one once I get the next section worked out....which is why I am making this post!  I've designed the new map editor for this resource management list and ... damn it's awesome.  Here's what my current system (not coded yet, but designed) supports:<ul><li>Custom-designed particle effects</li><li>Stacking map layers: this warrants some explanation.  This means that you'll be able to have as many ground-type layers as you want!  Want to stack a brick wall on top of a different kind of wall?  Go for it!  Want to put an object on top of a wall?  Sure!  Have multiple objects on one spot?  Yup.  Also, you'll be able to map out monster spawn points, special effects (like that fog that I showed), and much more</li><li>Unified compiled format, so you can *literally* copy-and-paste the file that the editor saves into the client's directory, start it up, and it will start using that map.</li></ul>
<br />
<br />
<br />This will probably have to wait until the weekend to get more work done on it, but I wanted to show you guys where we're headed.  This project is SO CLOSE to being releasable!  I want to get the new map editor finished and get animated meshes working.  Then, I'm going to purchase a bunch of content, a host, and get this game online!</div>

<br />That will kill the scarcity of mid/high level weapons. 
<br />Weapon/armor merchants are there to provide low level players with basic equipment. They can also help a fallen higher level get back on their feet. A silver sword is better than your fist if you just lost your lightning sword.</div>
