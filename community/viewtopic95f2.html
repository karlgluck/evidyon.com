				<div class="content">I have been following your progress for some time now.  I'm not sure why I haven't spoken up yet, but seeing it get this close to Alpha is getting me excited.  I've been around Xen since August '00.  I used to play pretty hardcore back in the older days, and I still pop in every once in a while to stay current on things.  If you ever have any ideas that you would like to bounce off of me, I would be honored.  Not sure if/when you played, but if you're an oldie, I'm sure you recognize my name.  ; )</div>

				<div class="content">Hey there, of course I remember you!  I played way back in the day, too, but I don't know if you would remember me--I was Ecrofresia, scallion cleric and Baron van Clyde, human theif.  I mostly hung around with Bonk Von Fuzzlewack.  My character was the first to find a dirus armor (that was after I quit and gave my character to a friend though) <img src="images/smilies/icon_smile.gif" alt=":)" title="Smile" /><br /><br />Glad to hear from you!  I've been tossing around a few ideas and I wouldn't mind running them by a neutral party.  I'll contact you probably after alpha goes out about 'em.</div>

				<div class="content">HA!  I totally remember your character.  Never really spoke to you much, but I have a good memory for names, places...etc.  Hi to you Thad.  I remember the two of us being makeshift technical support for a while.<br /><br />I appreciate the welcome responses.  I'm easy to get ahold of, so whenever you would like some input, I'll be around.  I've seen too much change in xen for the better/worse to NOT have some opinions and ideas, haha.<br /><br />Matt/Sex4Cash/Silent Ninja/Samsonite</div>
