				<div class="content">As I can see it, there is no reason why PV can't be networked and brought into being as a &quot;real&quot; internet game at this point.  Now that there's a map editor (albeit incomplete) it is possible to create somewhere to be--now I need to make a reason to be there.  That's what I'll be doing in the coming weeks: creating the PV server and hooking up the client to it.

				<div class="content">I can't actually say; I don't want to disappoint you if it takes longer <img src="./images/smilies/icon_wink.gif" alt=";)" title="Wink" />  I am going home for a break June 16th-June 23rd so I will be doing no coding during that point; however, I have more time to work on this than during the school year and I am very enthusiastic, so 2-3 weeks of working just on the game isn't unreasonable.  It might take longer than that in &quot;real time&quot; because I have a job that gets in the way, though.
<br />
<br />Don't worry--it's coming, and I'll keep you updated.</div>

				<div class="content">If you think about it the back-up and hit thing makes physical sense.
<br />If you run away, you shouldnt get hit, and of course your blow is going to hit if you're far enough away to lunge+strike.
<br />(EJ removed that? lol.. what else has he removed? trans while in pvp mode? [actually i wouldnt be surprised...])</div>
