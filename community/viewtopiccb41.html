				<div class="content">I finally got the chance to try the new update.  I went to hatchlings and they hurt but that was not the problem.  About 2 seconds of hunting caused me to get booted. When I logged back on, I was in the dark abyss with my LSA gone and experience penalty.  So I tried some skeleton and skeleton archers and the exact same thing happened.  Is this just me or is it happening to anyone else?</div>

				<div class="content">I have not had any problems.  Are you able to hunt anything else in game, like trolls or any other monsters in general? Anything other than the new update Skeletons and Hatchlings.<br /><br />The only time the server was down was yesterday the 1rst for about 20 seconds.  My brother turned off the power strip to our internet and cut the internet off for a few seconds.  Other than that, you shouldn't have any connection problems.  <br /><br />Just recently the lag seems to be setting in about every other day. I have been checking the in-game lag every day to keep up with it.</div>

				<div class="content">I figured it out, its not the hunting, its just the server was really laggy.  I think it needed a reset.  I'd say every 5 minutes it would go down and kick you off, than it would go back up again.  It happened to me and two other people that I met when I was playing.  Because of the lag, I would die and than the server would go down.  After when I logged back on, I would be in the black zone with experience loss.  I have so much exp penalty because of it lol.</div>

				<div class="content">Weird.  It must not have updated correctly...hrm.<br /><br />I think the lagging issue is coming from the server being slower now that it is run on a laptop.  Maybe defragging would help?</div>

				<div class="content">Ok the new limit is now officially 60, and works.  As tested by Corsix he was a ble to gain XP past level 35.<br /><br />Also xp points have been upped per kill.<br />I was getting 60 xp per kill and now am getting 257 per kill, that is pretty sick.<br />You will have to check it out for yourselves.<br />.</div>

				<div class="content">Yes, I do think it was upped way too much.<br />I do not have control over that, nor do I know how to fix it.<br />I believe it may be part of the server that I updated, but have no way to check how xp is gained.<br /><br />This is a Karl question.</div>

				<div class="content">Karl told me the xp is based on a percentage system that has to do with the highest achievable level.<br />In this case the pre-highest level attainable was 35. When the server was upped to level 60 as the highest, the xp system automatically kicked in to make it so that players can level at about the same rate as they were before.<br />That is the explaination to the xp jump.</div>

				<div class="content">But it doesn't explain the jump down again??  Before the experience changed I was getting abount 60 per kill.  When the experience changed I was getting abount 300.  But now I am getting about 150 or so.</div>

				<div class="content">I have been getting the same, round 150 now.  I don't know what to say about the jump down. <br />The above is what Karl told me, so anything other than that I am unsure of.</div>
