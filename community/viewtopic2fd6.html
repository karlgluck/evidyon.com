				<div class="content">Hey everyone,
<br />
<br />Thanks to Matt (and his mom) we have a great opportunity to meet with a professional lawyer...for free!  Hopefull we'll get to talk about protecting intellectual property/assets, becoming a company, etc.  We are still figuring out how to arrange transport as the firm is in Dallas, but here are the details:
<br />
<br /><span style="font-weight: bold">Wednesday, April 5, 2006</span> - This is an 'A' day.
<br />(tenatively) meet at 3:30 at GHS for a carpool
<br />Meeting is at 4:30 PM in Dallas.</div>

				<div class="content">Hey EDIT on karl's post, the time will actually be at 4:30 (my bad)
<br />
<br />my mom says she can give us all a ride, and she said 3:30 would be fine (for us to leave)..so...hopefully that'll allow more people to be included if they want to. 
<br />
<br />Let us know! this guy's supposed to be top of the line</div>

				<div class="content">ok, my issue with Unseen and legal crap is simple:  if we're a company, we have to worry about taxes and revenue and blah-blah-blah.  And frankly, I couldn't care less.  I think we might be better served by protecting our intellectual property as individuals and keeping the Unseen Studios and Born to Rule labels under Karl's name as a group hobby, rather than as a company.  I think that at this stage, making anything official will be far more trouble than it's worth.
<br />
<br />I don't know that I'll be able to make this meeting, though I'd really like to.</div>
