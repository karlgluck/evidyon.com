				<div class="content">I feel that stat resets should only be permitted after a stat effecting change to the game.  Otherwise you have xen syndrome where you level up a character for leveling speed, then respec for pvp.  This would pull from the balance of the game, even with a high cost for respec</div>

				<div class="content">Yeah people would probably just create alt accounts just to fill in the guild spots, that can be problematic.  I was thinking about adding a request for a new chat box to the list, but im not sure if people want this game's style to be like any other online game.  Are we trying to be distinguishable?</div>
