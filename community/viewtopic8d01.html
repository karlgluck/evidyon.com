				<div class="content">You guys are hilarious. This all started because i was under the suspicion that i took someones drop. It was some other dude that killed you and took the top of the stack, then he logged while i was tryin to get the rest of it and now it was assumed i took it. I will admit i have killed 3 other people for i guess a rare armor/axe/crown of talon? But since i did not take that other guys drop i will certainly not take the blame for it. Come on guys i will admit to everything else including the sq bug which i didnt mean to use, it just kinda happened and i will not admit to taking someones drop? Btw regret was not me...i was helping him actually today. I'm not a bad guy but wen u guys come at me with all this bull then yes i will go against u with all i got. lol Anyways hope this helps all the misunderstanding. Sorry about all of you losing the gear but hey dont pick on me...I am willing to truce with u guys =D</div>

				<div class="content">The only thing i have against you is the fact you killed and took gear from people I'm friends with. Thats all fine and dandy thats the point of the game, but don't expect me to be nice or friendly to you, i will kill you whenever i see you.<br /><br />And i will want to pvp you, even though, we both know thats not going to happen considering you don't have the testicular fortitude for that.<br /><br />You're making a big deal about people not liking you, it was never a big deal what you did, thats part of the game. I just don't get why you would expect people to like you, when you go around killing noobs who can't defend themselves, instead of pvping people your level like me.<br /><br />So accept the hatred towards you, and be prepared to drop that gear you think is &quot;rare&quot; lmao.</div>

				<div class="content">Ummm first off your friends attacked me... so i killed them and took there drops...i never attack first. Second i don't go killing noobs.. ask them all i help them if anything. Thirdly if its part of the game then why are u gettin mad who i'm killing? All this gear will be gone, so it wont matter. I didn't expect anyone to like me or even dislike me, i just played the game the way i thought i thought it should be played.</div>
