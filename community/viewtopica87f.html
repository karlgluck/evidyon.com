				<div class="content">I'm not sure about the stats-thing, never really tested it but i noticed the following:<br />Platinum rings give me less hp then bejeweled ones (+10 hp vs. +14hp) allthough the platinums have additionally +2 cons on them (now +2 cons might just be not enough to make it noticable).<br /><br />More ideas that haven't been mentioned in the first post:<br />- Chatlog<br />- Class (and Race) shown in the statscreen (i met several people who have no idea what class they are lawlz)<br /><br />Minor Bugs:<br />- The Evidyon Window shows the wrong version number (1.7.0 as opposed to 1.7.3 in the serverscreen)<br />- Some Items show '+0 MP' allthough they clearly add more then 0 mp :p<br /><br />Less important additions for later use:<br />(- Storage)<br />(- Consumable Items -&gt; Being able to stack Items)<br /><br />Edit: As for the landmarks, i don't really see this as a big problem at the current state of the game. All you have to do is to look besides the path you're on from time to time to check what stuff spawns in that area. And most of the time monsters run around on the paths anyways so you have an idea of what's around you.</div>

				<div class="content">Yea Sankt that's why I believe +stats don't work. Also someone else mentioned in game they didn't. Imagine the damage you'll do with the additional +strength bone gear! =P<br /><br />Also in regard to the item that has the +2 cons, how will that effect our characters? Assuming cons just affects our HP would this mean it works like a Salubris ring did in Xenimus, giving us a +% hp gain based on our base_hp rather than just a +hp bonus? If so could you change it to show us what % we're gaining rather than how much cons.</div>
