				<div class="content">Hey Rabit,<br /><br />I was not planning on using graphical icons quite yet for the items in your inventory.  You bring to mind a good question though--do you actually like Xen's new inventory?  Personally,  I find it hard to use and less awesome than the old text one.<br /><br />Karl</div>

				<div class="content">Well.. Personally I like it to be more organized.. and it having a list of items, it gets confusing cause if you die, you have to find out what you lost, but in kind pic, its perfectly organized and you automaticly know whats missing or what can be added.<br /><br />But with a list of items your wearing it just gets kinda annoying to me..</div>

				<div class="content">Pfft... this is all just a roughdraft, and of course the equipment list can be longer, but this is just all scrunched together to show an example.<br /><br />People want to see their equipment without having to equip it, being able to see it in the inventory, the stats are a must... but many others want the list as xen used to be. I'm one of the ones that believes in text&gt;picture, but my mind is still open to having images accompany the items.<br /><br />In your original post, you express you want to see only the models, and ... see the stats on rightclick much like Xenimus and half of every other MMORPG out there these days? Now you're saying the way it is now in game is perfectly 100% fine, except you think the item details list is unnecessary...? This is a little confusing dude.<br /><br />I gave my suggestion, hope a bunch of people like it as I tried to mesh everyone's interests into one simple one solution.<br /><br />P.S. I'm not one to point out obvious minute flaws that are easily ignored because of it being a rough draft suggestion as  you did to me... if I wanted to, I could point out that necklaces and rings are pretty much under the same item type, such as being able to wear 6 rings, or 6 necklaces... I could ask you how would the item details show, and I could also say your suggestion looks really ugly and I hope someone would make it look better in game instead of yours. Please don't take my suggestions 100% literally, they're <span style="text-decoration: underline">suggestions</span>.</div>

Thats why I like yours, I don't mind not seeing the pictures in mine.. But yours shows the list of items like :<br />____<br />Weapon : &quot;Weapon Name&quot;<br />Armor: &quot;Armor Name&quot;<br />Shield: &quot;Shield Name&quot;<br />Ect and so on..<br />____<br />Which I actually really like personally, even better then mine..  <img src="./images/smilies/icon_mrgreen.gif" alt=":mrgreen:" title="Mr. Green" /> <br /><br />It would probably even be easier to script lol..<br /><br />#### mine, I like yours!</div>

				<div class="content">Well, I think the best way a stats page can be set is to have everything set out perfectly and easy to see and understand... also have it worthy of showing off, like if your friend(s) are over and you want to show off your stats and character, open stats screen and have a screen thats easier to impress.<br /><br />Xen's stats screen could be impressive, but it wasn't THAT impressing most of the time, it wasn't too catchy.<br /><br />I'll see if I can come up with something real nice.</div>
