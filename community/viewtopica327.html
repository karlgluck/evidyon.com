				<div class="content">Well i think you've done a mistake in the way you made mana and hp, reason stated below:)<br /><br />you've made it so that if you want hp/mana you have to check a point on cons or wis.. but you forgot they are passive so that if you where to put 1 point on wisdom, and 1 point equals f.ex 10 mana.. that means you would gain 10 mana per level.. same with cons unless you put another point making it f.ex 20 per lvl.<br /><br />correct me if im wrong here, this is specificly cons and wis which acts like this, cause i remember Alko telling me to put 21 on cons because it was a bonus, and i would gain more hp each lvl for it, str agility and intel though being dmg stats are not passive.<br /><br />ALSO, hunters should not be using mana it doesnt seem right, im thinking energy instead like rogues on WoW, and you could only have 100 energy and it would regen according to your agility(only because it seems right)<br />And some attacks which probably will be used frequently should cost less while powerfull ones might cost more.<br /><br />Warriors, warriors should not use mana either unless they were to be able to chose a hero class or something like paladin later, they should stick to ferocity or something as a powersource<br /><br />being that they are warriors, they enjoy battle and all of its aspects, 100 ferocity maximum like the rogue only the warrior does not regenerate his rage he has to attack for it to increase.<br />(i realize these ideas have been used b4 btw)</div>

Energy which you have stored within your body.</div>

				<div class="content">makes no sense at all changing melee clases to energy... Please define your definition of a critic? somebody who is payed to criticize games? or just your average Joe criticizing... none the less such a change would not add to the game play experience. Had this game been made by a big studio mayby then theyd give a #### about what critics said but this is made by what 3 people or some poo? critics mean poo, these guys have the rare opportunity of been able to do what the #### they want without needing to sway with popular opinion... hence why I'm into it.</div>

MP is passive.  There is absolutely NO DIFFERENCE from how we do our stats as compared to Xen's, if you're considering post-2003 Xenimus</span> except that our equations are (1) more stable (2) easier to balance and (3) generate numbers that start around 50-70 rather than 5.  If you respec to 30 cons in xen at level 50, you'll get the same hp as someone who added points to get 30 cons at level 10 and just kept it there for the next 40 levels.</div>
