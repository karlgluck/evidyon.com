				<div class="content">Of course we're planning more classes!  I don't know exactly when we'll be rolling them all out, but there should be a few more for Beta and at least 7 by the time we get to commercial.  But please, share your ideas--it always helps to have more input.</div>

				<div class="content">I think the Hunter class sounds pretty wicked. Though, I really disliked how Xenimus went about it. Arrows fired weirdly across the map and were not smooth at all. That and there wasn't a lot of bows to use.<br /><br />I think classes should really be built upon chaining attacks together to get different effects. So if you fired off a Fire Shot that would cause your Arrow Spin to do Fire Damage instead. And then Unholy Shot would cause Arrow Spin to cause Disease damage, Ice would do Ice damage etc.</div>
