EXP-loss, that's another question.  We would have to reframe the question and focus strictly on why one might be better than the other.</div>

				<div class="content">Very true Joe.<br /><br /><br />And players: give us some credit eh?  We love you guys, and we'll help you out.  Chances are that when the level cap is increased/removed, all exp penalties will be reset.<br /><br />Note that this is not a promise or a guarantee, just saying that you shouldn't worry so much =)<br /><br />~Erich</div>

I don't know just throwing out random suggestions.  <img src="images/smilies/icon_eek.gif" alt=":shock:" title="Shocked" /></div>
