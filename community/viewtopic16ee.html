				<div class="content">Server is using the new one.<br /><br />Someone brought it down by attack-running into a teleporter though =p  I have uploaded a patch that should prevent this from happening again.<br /><br />Also, I have taken the opportunity to adjust how int/str affect spell and melee damage respectively.  The difference should be *very* noticeable now--there was a bug in how I was calculating damage that actually gave people with lower than a certain amount of int or str a big boost to their damage!  Ha.</div>

It does not have a limit in movement speed.  For now I would work on another stat until at least level 30.</div>

				<div class="content">Maybe we should implement some sort of Server status function to the main website? Having to post on the board to confirm its not a bug on the client end is kinda annoying and it fills up the board with junk lol.</div>
