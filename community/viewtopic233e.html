				<div class="content">would you mind uploading the texture for me to get an idea of how you make them?  I have over 6 years of 3d design experience, but mainly for engineering/drafting where I haven't had to use many textures.  So I can pump out models no problem, it's the texture part that I'm not all too familiar with.</div>

I'm asking questions, not making accusations or trying to belittle you in any way.  You, however, take offense at whatever you can and reply in a negative, childish manner.  I don't appreciate it.<br /><br />I ignored it the first time, now you're just being a plain douche.  <br /><br />Yes, you CAN break up any polygon into simpler polygons a.k.a. triangles, that's not really what's in question here.  I don't get why you would calculate the number of triangles in your mesh and figure that is the polygon count.  If that were the case, why the hell would you even call it a polygon count?  Since, by definition, it would be a &quot;triangle count&quot;.  Blender also goes into some detail in how you can model using triangles as well as quadrilaterals.  They also make a note in a number of different tutorials on how you should avoid triangles on any surface other than a flat surface, as in many cases this leads to &quot;artifacts&quot; or graphical disturbances.  Sometimes different video cards interpret these in different ways, or some simply don't show the artifacts when some do.  <br /><br />One example of these artifacts is the old diabolic plate that Ej used in Xenimus.  For a number of people, anytime a diabolic plate would be on the screen, HUGE white triangles would form from the spiked shoulders.  I emailed Ej regarding this phenomena, he changed the model, and presto.  No graphical artifacts.  <br /><br />The point is, I started off by stating two pointers.  I was trying to be helpful.  I wasn't being condescending.  Thadius also  had the problem when he started doing the models, not realizing that he had to use UVs rather than just textures.  I didn't know if you even had any relevant modeling experience.  Well, you reply with some meanie remark stating that you had 3 years of experience and blah blah blah... Ok, cool.  Now that I know you have experience, I ask you how you do your UV textures.  I also asked you why your model was completely constructed with triangles, as it was against all the literature that I have ever read on 3d Modeling and gaming.  They were simple, innocent questions.  No need to take offense, and definitely no need to be an bum.</div>
