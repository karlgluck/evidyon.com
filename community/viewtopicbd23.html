				<div class="content">Granted I know this game isn't ready for public release and still needs a lot of work.. However I figured I would throw my two cents out there just for reference.<br /><br />Visual<br /><br />+ The rich colors make the game feel alive.. <br />+ I really like the appearance of the water..<br />+ I dig the sexy black wife beater that my character has on.<br /><br />- Weapons and Armors seem to kind of float around the characters rather than being connected to them.<br />- Some sheilds seem rather large in relation to the characters<br />- Walking animation could use some work... he reminds me of quazi motto when he walks around.<br />- Spin doesn't spin.<br /><br />Gameplay<br /><br />+ Pretty smooth and without lag outs<br />+ Challenging yet not impossible game play.<br /><br />- Spawn likes to get bunched up around the water's edge and cliffs. Don't get me wrong.. I love easy kills but its something that needs work.<br />- Spin seems to make baddies run away when I hit them with it while moving.<br />- Walking around water as well as cliffs is a little bit difficult and may be why enemies get hung up around those areas.<br />- Adding additional armor didn't seem to help my defense too much. <br /><br />Okay... theres a small list of good things and things that could use work, based upon playing this latest release.</div>
