<br />
<br />Im working on t3 caslte+town, the town inside the castle walls. the caslte being 2 or even 3 storys high. throne room on second floor 
<br />
<br />how can i add stair cases, and ladders?iron/wooden chests? 
<br />
<br />also i was thinking for ALL towns the storage npc sould be on a safe sqaure im sure 90% of people would agree to something like this, we all know how sucky it was to get pked while taking gear out of storage on x1...</div>

<br />i need to add bushes and trees and things like that.
<br />there are no nice thinner walls for houses. so big stone work will have to do for now.

				<div class="content">That looks so awesome. And I agree about the quests and merchants. I hate how you find some random building and think oo must be some rare merchant or quest and you go in to find nothing but a bed and a book case.. Maybe this is what you can use the custom guards and merchants for. From the people that donated</div>

<br />each of the four corners on the 1st level will have ladders going up and down except for the top left. top left tower is like a secret room not really secret, but a good chest awaits in that room. the top right tower is mainly used for storage. and it has a mana pool =P</div>
