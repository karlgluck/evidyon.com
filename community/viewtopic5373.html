				<div class="content">hey guys,<br /><br />I have to say I like the idea of actually being able to loose equipped items, this was one thing I think most of us enjoyed one way or another when PKing in Xenimus. I would love to see this in PV, but obviously with the ability to not be repeatedly pked or dieing over and over (especially when monster or PKER stands on top of you dead) loosing items like said above.<br /><br />so from my point of view I think that being able to have the &quot;option&quot; to release ourselves to our hometown, with the obvious sacrifice of items in the inventory, would this include the all inventory slots +1 equipped?, then obviously will need to adventure back to your pile of items before anyone else finds the pile.<br /><br />I like that Idea very much, Hope this is used <img src="./images/smilies/icon_smile.gif" alt=":)" title="Smile" /><br /><br /><br /><br />All the Best!!<br /><br />Richard</div>

				<div class="content">I like that idea Karl...<br /><br />As for balancing chests (keeping people from hitting them up so much that it floods the game with gold)<br /><br />I think ALL dungeons should prevent people from marking them. At least anywhere close to the chests. That would keep people from porting in there every time the chest respawns. <br /><br />Also the amount of gold that comes from chests would depend on the difficulty of the dungeons monsters and puzzles (and yes I think there should be more puzzles). That way, at a certain point... the amount of gold that comes out of the chest would be so insignificant to the upper level character that they would be wasting their time to get to the chests in places they can fly through in a hurry.<br /><br />Another way to regulate chests is to simply tweak their respawn rate. I don't know how often they should respawn, so that would take a little testing.</div>

				<div class="content">what about if chests were none respawnable? or only under special conditions, and only held money. I mean in an obvious world, if you loot a chest it will not &quot;respawn&quot; yes it is fantasy yes it can do as fantasy pleases but. What about when a character dies, looses money (small amount) then another character dies, looses money, this is all given to the server not to the ground, when enough money has accumulated from in game players money. Respawn Chest with money value set by Karl.<br /><br />for example.<br /><br /><span style="text-decoration: underline"><span style="font-weight: bold">Chest A - 75 Silver</span></span><br /><br />&lt;&gt;  Player 3 loots 75 Silver.<br />&lt;&gt;  Chest (in state of unlootable).<br />&lt;&gt;  Player 1 level 10, Dies in the world (Drop 21 Silver to server).<br />&lt;&gt;  Player 2 level 20, Dies in the world (Drop 56 Silver to server).<br />&lt;&gt;  Chest A (Requires 75 Silver from server).<br />&lt;&gt;  Chest A Restarts.<br /><br /><br /><span style="text-decoration: underline"><span style="font-weight: bold">Chest B - 1 Golden Coin</span></span><br /><br />&lt;&gt;  Player 3 loots 1 Golden Coin.<br />&lt;&gt;  Chest B (in state of unlootable).<br />&lt;&gt;  Player 1 level 30, Dies in the world (Drop 60 Silver to server).<br />&lt;&gt;  Player 2 level 40, Dies in the world (Drop 60 Silver to server).<br />&lt;&gt;  Chest B (Requires 1 Golden Coin from server).<br />&lt;&gt;  Chest B Restarts.<br /><br /><br /><span style="text-decoration: underline"><span style="font-weight: bold">Chest C - 20 Silver</span></span><br /><br />&lt;&gt;  Player 3 loots 20 Silver.<br />&lt;&gt;  Chest C (in state of unlootable).<br />&lt;&gt;  Chest D (Requires 20 Silver from server).<br />&lt;&gt;  Chest D Restarts. (Using Excess from Chest B example.)<br /><br /><span style="font-style: italic">*** Obviously this wouldn't be the same chest that respawned right after being looted, it would go to a different chest requiring 20 Silver ***</span><br /><br /><span style="font-weight: bold">Notice that levels incur different values of currency?, I mean 30 + I have as 60Silver per death, but obviously these are ammendible values so there are not definate systematic figures.</span><br /><br />Do you think this way money will be a reusable source? people wont become too wealthy from this method?, I mean it depends on how many chests are scattered accross the huge map, but the chances of standing by a chest and waiting for people to die for the server to restart the chest is very limited.<br /><br />These losses of gold should really only accur when dieing from a monster do you think?, not during PVP or PKing.<br /><br /><br />I would really like to know your thoughs on this please?<br /><br /><br /><br />Richard</div>

				<div class="content">This thread is starting to get a bit derailed with how chests should work.. someone should make a thread about it.<br /><br />Anyway about bags, if you are to implement them I think they should be &quot;consumed&quot; upon death and function as non-trade, non-drop items. Basically, you either find them or earn them through a quest. You'd have flexibility over how difficult you want the game to be by adjusting their droprate%. <br /><br />If you decide that there be no bags then I think Inventory + 1 equipped item drop at death is the most reasonable idea so far.. dropping all your gear is just too much punishment.</div>

				<div class="content">Or make it to where the is no 100% way of keeping your equipped items on death.<br /><br />Make it to where magic bags are rare, to a certain degree, but also make it to where they have only a 50% chance of keeping your item upon dying.<br /><br />This could also be slightly extended, make a different item, that would have something like a 25% chance of keeping your inventory upon dying.<br /><br />Furthermore, you could make the bags have a lifespan of 30 deaths or something like that, but make it to where if the bag prevents a character from dropping an item, they drop the magic bag instead.<br /><br />And don't post the durability of the bag, so if someone just so happens to be using a bag that already has been through 29 deaths (note: deaths not the bags actually dropping) the next time they die, the bag disappears and they drop an item upon death regardless.<br /><br /><br />This ensures pking definitely has its benefits, and gives people some sort of safety in the world. Obviously the percents and numbers I gave were just a hypothetical number to be toyed with, the idea is still the same. So for it to be &quot;safer&quot; the bag chance could be something like 75%. Either way.. any pker still gets an item from killing someone. Whether it be something the person is wearing, or a coveted magic bag of his own.</div>
