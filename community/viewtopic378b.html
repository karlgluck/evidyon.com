				<div class="content">Welp, I guess it's got some bugs, but you triggered the anti-duping system.  Somehow your sword was duped when you pulled it from storage, so the server deleted it.   <img src="images/smilies/icon_eek.gif" alt=":shock:" title="Shocked" /> <br /><br />Don't worry I can score you a new one.  Find me in game sometime.</div>

I have a feeling the bug is pretty subtle, but since it doesn't break the game at this very second I have to wait until after this Friday's bonanza to take a good hard look at it (and a lot of other bugs).</div>
