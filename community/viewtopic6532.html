				<div class="content">ok the reason they only sell level 1-3 gear is because back then that gear was actually good
<br />
<br />I used to save up to buy a silver sword, magic mace, magic leather, etc because those items were actually useful
<br />(remember, this is back before props, and when reflective gear was rare and lightning was uber leet</div>

				<div class="content">i believe the rarity of an item is 100% based on how often it drops. of course reflective will not be dropping often when the game comes out. and if you did manage to find one early in the game you would be a fool to sell to a merchant when you can get 100 times the value from a fellow player.  i dont believe this idea would ruin any part of the game. even after several years i dont imagine all level 1-12 gear would be in there. 
<br />
<br />things like dragon swords (drops all the time from warriors)
<br />fire swords (drops from skell warriors)
<br />fire staves (drops from adepts)
<br />these will be the 1st type of items in the 'commons' merchant. 
<br /><span style="text-decoration: underline">if they are so common you can<span style="font-weight: bold"> give </span>them away why cant a merchant sell it?</span>
<br />
<br />
<br />after 3-4 years i would guess all lvl 1-8 gear.
<br />after 5-6 years lightning gear might make it in.
<br />
<br />this is something that could work really well for all <span style="font-weight: bold">future</span> players.
<br />
<br />
<br />Ratiotile, my idea was not to make proped gear or good gear avaliable to just anyone. it was to have merchants sell better gear than regular swords, regular chain mail. of course the gear would very slowly become avaliable as the games grows... i think this is the part Vitriol is getting hung up about. it would take several years to get even a dragon helm to show up in this merchant. as of right now i have never found more than 3 dragon helm on xenimus in one day. and even with that i can sell a dragon helm to a noob for 10 times what i could sell to a merchant. this is not something that would help the founders of this game. this is an idea that would help this game a good push tward growth.</div>

<br />
<br />Agreed... lets end this thread here, this is a good idea. Oviously Karl will find an equation to make this balanced if he uses it in the game.</div>

				<div class="content">Remember alot of those enemies were not in early xenimus. I dont oppose the idea of them being in the game. I dont even oppose the idea of enemies which carry fire swords etc dropping them. I just dont want this gear to become common 9 days after we make a general release. Certainly EJ's &quot;consignment&quot; feature was one of his better ideas. I do not oppose something like that from being added, in fact I encourage it. For a long while money was almost worthless in xenimus, consignment gave it purpose. So thats a good thing. 
<br />What we have to remember is that this game isnt going to have hard level requirements. I dont want people spawning in and demanding gold so they can go purchase a full ref set and dragon sword at the merchant. It just wrecks the whole RPG aspect of constantly improving your character via abilities and equipment.</div>

				<div class="content">ok what if i asked to apply the same idea but lower the gear level so level 6 (reflective, fire) would be the highest items avaliable?
<br />
<br />i too like the idea of consignment shop and volucris would benifit from one. im just trying to save karl some coding to get the game asap  <img src="./images/smilies/icon_razz.gif" alt=":P" title="Razz" /> 
<br />
<br />a consignment shop could come in a later update.</div>

				<div class="content">haha thank you zigg, I've got a lot on my plate as it is <img src="./images/smilies/icon_smile.gif" alt=":)" title="Smile" />
<br />
<br />If it is possible, I'd like you guys to boil down a list of features you'd like to see implemented, in order, starting from a game that has essentially nothing once you log in other than the ability to walk around and talk to other players.  This will aid me in which direction to take when coding.
<br />
<br />The intricacies of the game mechanics are fun to design, but right now we're missing some HUGE parts of the game that need to be constructed, such as how skills work, what skills people have, what races we're going to use, classes, class progressions, a (general) description of towns, ....</div>
