				<div class="content">I'm sorry to hear that you've had a rough time with the game.  I'd normally never have allowed this critical of a bug to persist for more than a few hours, let alone days.  Find me in-game sometime, or send me a PM when you'll be online later this week and I'll see what I can do.  For now, I hope you can tolerate the problems (or maybe take a break today and come back once I fix this tonight!)</div>
