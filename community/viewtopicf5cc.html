				<div class="content">Well, I think that the run functionality is really really good and it effectively replaces the Gas ability in Xenimus (which kind of seemed weird any way).<br /><br />The only problem I seem to see with this at the moment is that to recreate the xenimus touch and feel, I think that the run ability causes the effects to be slightly distorted or not feel truly like Xenimus. That said, I definitely feel that it should stay (because its concept is awesome! <img src="images/smilies/icon_biggrin.gif" alt=":D" title="Very Happy" />) but I propose an adjustment!<br /><br />If you play in game without the run ability set, I instantly start feeling after about 10 to 15 minutes of levelling that this is Xenimus orientated and feels precisely as you would want it to feel!, but instantly as soon as I start running around at gas form speed fighting monsters, the effect of a Xenimus feeling is slightly hindered.<br /><br />I believe it is because:<br />1. The speed at which you will be naturally walking around the map is increased. (with the ability to still attack monsters, which is unlike Xenimus feeling)<br />2. There is no fear of using the run or speedup ability. (Xenimus with Gas you would sacrifice being able to cast spells, making it dangerous).<br />3. 90% of your time will be spent travelling, which is fine, but knowing you can openly attack things or run away very quickly poses no threats along your journey.<br /><br />This being said may seem very minute but in fact I personally think that it has a major impact on the recreation of the Xenimus tone. I also think that if this is slightly tweaked and adjusted it could completely change the feel of the game for the better! <img src="images/smilies/icon_razz.gif" alt=":P" title="Razz" /><br /><br /><br />What I suggest is that when the run ability is active there could be a few possibilities or a mixture (if daring enough <img src="images/smilies/icon_razz.gif" alt=":P" title="Razz" />), to play with here:<br />1. All MP is held at Zero<br />2. Damage taken is increased by 300%<br />3. Defence is reduced<br />4. Run time effect reduced (especially considered for Beta)<br /><br />With some of these I feel that would bring some elements of danger to your journey and to combat aimlessly running and attacking super fast without a care but that is just my opinion anyway! <img src="images/smilies/icon_razz.gif" alt=":P" title="Razz" /><br /><br />See what you think!:D<br /><br />Richard</div>

				<div class="content">id suggest somewhat another ability than running, phasing into another dimension, you can still see monsters while you run fast, but you can be attacked and cant attack back and f.ex like you said increased dmg on you by some %, that way you would only have to turn the player blue or something to show that he is phasing at the moment, Neon blue suggestion for the phasing cause it will make you more noticable which is a hinder while you are traveling.<br /><br />Never liked the fact that people could attack while sprinting around, also it should be dissruptable like gas form if people would try to get away.<br /><br />if you saw Chronicles of Riddick and remember the boss of the necromongers, that is how i am seeing phasing should be.<br /><br />my view of the ability is explore and traveling only for lower lvls before they get teleport or something, or maybe quik manouver in combat if you got skills.<br /><br />anyway that is my idea.<br /><br />anyway Mutatio Nimbus from xen made it possible to travel across big holes on the ground and water, which is why i think it was a good idea.<br /><br />so first you would get phasing, then a upgrade that would allow you to walk on water until it was taken off and you would have to swim.</div>

				<div class="content">Actually scrap this post,<br /><br />I just realised how annoying run attack on Xenimus was to travel faster than normal lol! the speed issue may have something to do with agility too im guessing! <img src="images/smilies/icon_razz.gif" alt=":P" title="Razz" />, so i'm pretty much done for! <img src="images/smilies/icon_biggrin.gif" alt=":D" title="Very Happy" /> haha</div>
