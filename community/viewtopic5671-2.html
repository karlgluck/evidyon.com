				<div class="content">With the promised Stat respec coming up soon there is a theory I would like to test out in order to pursue an ideal build for me.  Has anyone confirmed Agility effecting casting speed? Would anyone be interested in helping me test this theory?<br /><br />Secondly, are there any theories as to how strength could improve a mage class, I know it has any effect on hp.  Would you put this in the same catagory as putting int on a meelee.  And theories as to which is more helpful to a meelee wis or int.  (Both seem pretty equal to me.)</div>
