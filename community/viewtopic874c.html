				<div class="content">Some of us might remember how chests used to be the main way of acquiring awesome gear.  
<br />
<br />Then EJ nerfed them, and they became useless, until he added the mystic chests and later &quot;pulls&quot;.
<br />
<br />I don't think we want to go back to the days where chests completely drove the xen economy, but I think we should at least make them useful.
<br />
<br />How about having chests spawn pots?  The occasional sucky item would be fine, but seriously, the days of finding just 2 clubs, a throwing star, and a dagger in every lvl 18 chest need to stop.  Getting a few meds/trans/maxies/etc. would actually be useful, especially at lower levels.  
<br />
<br />In addition to having chests spawn pots, we can also have the usual pulls.  Personally, I'm against the idea of pulls, but I realize not everyone is going to feel that way.</div>

				<div class="content">Yeah, I remember finding a bag on a level 2 newb in a wooden chest WAY back when mystic was the best gear out, and you dropped all your gear when you died. How are you going to find a bag nowadays on a level that low? You're not... plain and simple.. you would be hard pressed to find many bags at wizzies. I personally like the idea of useful chests as well Ender, and I think it would be a great idea to implement in the game. I'm all for it, and I'm sure most others would be as well. Great idea.</div>

				<div class="content">I believe I made a comment about chests in a different topic but I will repeat my opinion here. I would really like to see useful chests, I am not an old school player, but nor am I a newb to the game either. The idea of chest pulls is alright, I would like to see chests become more useful... Picking up pots, magic bags, and other things of the sort wouldn't be a bad thing... I also think that if a chest is in a very difficult area to get to (difficult enemies and or bosses) I think the chest should either put forth better items depending on the difficulty. I think this would increase the amount of exploration instead of the repedative leveling</div>

				<div class="content">I agree. There should be fewer chests and those should be slightly harder, like at the end of a dungeon or in a secret room. When you pull from a chest you should get an item suitable for your level. Say you were level 20, then the chest would give an item that may have a requirement for level 20-25. What I'm sick of is the amazing xenimus chest pulls, e.i. an adept ring while others get a mystic sword. Chest pulls should be somewhat balanced and have a fair less random level range. I don't like everything to be a gamble.</div>

				<div class="content">Welcome paz, good first post!
<br />
<br />Heres another idea. Lower level chests cannot be opened by higher levels.
<br />
<br />Keep the current wooden, metal, and mystic chests, and have each one have a level limit (except mystic).
<br />
<br />Have there be just a few of these, and when you pull one you get something suited to your level and class.</div>

<br />I have to agree with the whole topic here. Chests should by and large drop gold, potions, scrolls, etc. With the occasional USEFUL item. Perhaps 1/20 chest opens should give an item useful for that character at that level. 
<br />but thadius, monsters in xenimus have dropped decent amounts of gold for some time now. I routinely kill imps that drop 10 silver or more. (1k old gold) 
<br />
<br />However, the Thief subclass (not the archer but the thief) should definatly  get some sort of bonus.</div>
