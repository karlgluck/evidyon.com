				<h3>Status Report!</h3>
				<div class="date"><img src="./styles/prosilver/imageset/icon_post_target.gif" width="11" height="9" alt="Post" title="Post" />Posted: <strong>Sun Dec 14, 2008 9:03 am</strong></div>

				<div class="content">I have my biggest final tomorrow morning, so I need to study pretty much all day for it.  However, this means that I'll have Tuesday through Thursday to work on Evidyon!  Then, after my final exam, it's time to buckle down and get this thing commercial!!!<br /><br />As of this morning, I have reassembled the special FX engine (so far, particles are working again--but soon to be more!), tested out the teleport spell (and nicely fixed the ranging hack) and have done some preliminary lag testing.  By simulating lag on the connection using some carefully-placed delays, I have determined that this game will be smoothly playable with a ping of up to 400 ms under 30% jitter (i.e. ping randomly changing from 280 to 520 ms).  Of course, the faster your connection the less lag you will experience.  As far as bandwidth requirements go, the game requires (client-side) roughly 1KBps per 20 players on the screen.  A 56k modem gives about 7 times that amount.  <img src="./images/smilies/icon_biggrin.gif" alt=":D" title="Very Happy" /><br /><br />So for the near future, the plan is:<br />- test out new projectile spells, including VFV<br />- fix loose ends (display HP/mp, activate stats screen, repair key binding screen...mostly programming back-end stuff)<br />- get enchantments working and displaying on characters<br />- re-enable sound effects (should be trivial)<br />- add monsters back into the game<br />- add equipment &amp; items<br />**at this point we'll be back at the current game!**</div>

				<div class="content">Err if it helps, the sound effects work as I tab back into Evidyon if I tabbed out.. That's the only time I ever hear them. Maybe it's a problem with sounds playing only when the window is focused?</div>

				<div class="content">Wow, cool that that would work <img src="./images/smilies/icon_smile.gif" alt=":)" title="Smile" />  The reason that they got disabled is I was messing with the volume controls...maybe tabbing resets that?</div>

				<div class="content">I meant that only as it's tabbing back in. After the window is fully restored, though, the sounds stop. Like, I would hear the sound of an enemy attacking me or something one time, if they are attacking me as I tab in.</div>

Yeah one thing I loved about Xen was the enchantments showing up and actually *doing* something to your character.  I think a lot of the appeal of the game was that there was so much visual information--armors, weapons, shields, enchantments...I mean high level chars LOOKED high-level, and that was cool.<br /><br />So yes, I'm definitely keeping that <img src="./images/smilies/icon_biggrin.gif" alt=":D" title="Very Happy" /></div>

But thats mainly because there isn't 900 sets of different items.. You were kind of stuck with a few different good weapons, Like any1 level 25-35 was using mainly just regular decent stuff.. But higher and higher, you start seeing Demonic leather, Diabolic, Dirus, and Ominex (And so one) where you knew.. NOT TO #### with them  <img src="./images/smilies/icon_twisted.gif" alt=":twisted:" title="Twisted Evil" /></div>
