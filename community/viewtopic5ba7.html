				<div class="content">Sorry everyone, but it's necessary because I changed the way items are referenced and you'll all end up with different items than you have right now in the next update if I don't wipe.  This could also let you get access to some of the really nifty stuff I'm adding without actually having to go find it...and although it'd be admittedly cool to get your hands on 10 of the &quot;energetic emerald sword&quot; or the &quot;vile topaz falchion&quot; just because you had a few extra clubs in your inventory, they're supposed to be rare <img src="images/smilies/icon_razz.gif" alt=":P" title="Razz" /><br /><br />On a more fun note, here's a preview of what's coming!  Probably tomorrow evening:<ul><li>Items on character</li><li>Enchantment (buffing) spells</li><li>A whole bunch of new monsters</li><li>Possibly new spell types</li><li>A ton of new items</li></ul><br /><div class="inline-attachment"><!-- ia0 -->items-on-character.PNG<!-- ia0 --></div></div>
