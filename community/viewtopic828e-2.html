When you reach certain levels and learn a new spell, they'll talk to you about it.<br /><br />&quot;Oh, young wizard, I see you have learned the midus spell.

				<div class="content">Agreed. That would be a very useful addition to help learn spells. <br /><br />To expand on that idea, once you level up and gain the new spells/abilities you could go to this NPC and a window would open up, such as when you talk to a merchant, listing each spell you learnt for that level and maybe tool tip descriptors when you mouse over them. If you click on one of the spells, the window will close and the NPC will give a demonstration of the spell while explaining it. You could have a wooden manikin next to him/her which they cast the spell on.</div>

				<div class="content">My vote is &quot;Ciphered Language with description&quot;<br /><br />I think the names should be ciphered, but still easy to understand/simplified. I found a site for multiple methods of translation of specific words from English to Latin.<br /><br />There's another aspect that plays a role in spell names for games... the abbreviations! When it comes to the appeal of the game, how things are abbreviated actually does have an affect on how players feel the game. This is also why keeping things simple is appealing, players can relate and share the same agreed abbreviations they like... I'm just bringing this mental aspect to your attention to help choose spell names.<br /><br />I like the idea of the NPC's who inform you of the spells you learn.<br /><br />This site and the words seem to match up perfectly with a great feel of the words to match a good feel from in the game, Here are some examples, the words, and what they mean in english. I'll put probable abbreviations/nicknames in quotes, and Xen Equivalents as &quot;XE&quot;.<br /><br />Examples:<br /><br />Socius Rememdium: ally heal - This is an example of a bad abbreviation... it's horrific looking, doesn't sound too good--at least not in my opinion--and doesn't match a good abbreviation... so perhaps a different pair of words would be better such as this next one...<br /><br />Curatus Comitis: Heal Friend/Comrade &quot;CC / group heal / comitis&quot;<br />XE: none really, except heal all.<br /><br />Curatus: heal &quot;heal / cure / cura / curatus&quot;<br />XE: mederi<br /><br />Magus Fulsi - Magical Flash/Shine/Beam. &quot;MF / Fulsi / Magus&quot;<br />XE: could be beam, or wiz bomb, ect.<br /><br />Grandire Alacritas: Increase Quickness &quot;GA / alac&quot;<br />XE: velocitas<br /><br />Grandire Validus: Increase Strength/Power/Vigor &quot;GV / vali/ valid&quot;<br />XE: robur<br /><br />Grandire Totus: Increase Entire/All &quot;GT / totus / multi buff&quot;<br />This could be used for pretty much the old all-buff spell.<br />XE: Multi Animagicus (I Think)<br /><br />Lux Lucis Fulsi: Light Beam/Flash &quot;LLF, beam, fulsi&quot;<br />XE: Lunae Lumen Nex, moonbeam.<br /><br />Vigoratus: Stout, Hearty... could be used as an HP Regen spell &quot;vigor&quot;<br />XE: none<br /><br />Curatus Valde: Heal Very Much / Heal Greatly &quot;CV or probably same as curatus&quot;<br />XE: Vis Mederi / high lvl mederi<br /><br />Magus Telum: Magical Arrow/Dart, could be a spell for ranged-weapons.<br />XE: none<br /><br />Incendere: set fire to/burn/scorch &quot;incend / fire&quot;<br />XE: flamma<br /><br />Magus Glacies/Glacialis: Magical Ice. &quot;glacies / ice&quot;<br />XE: Freeze<br /><br />Persultare Trans: Leap/Jump across/over. &quot;trans&quot;<br />XE: Pergere Trans<br />_________________<br />Words<br /><br />Altus: high, matured, great, deep, noble, ancient, old, secret.<br /><br />Validus: mighty, powerful, exceeding, vigorous, strong, robust, able.<br /><br />Veneficus: poisonous, magical, witch, wizard, caster of spells.<br /><br />Luna: moon.<br /><br />Fulsi: to flash, shine, beam.<br /><br />Lux Lucis: light.<br /><br />Servo: to preserve, guard, to watch over, keep, protect, observe, save.<br /><br />Totus: whole, entire, complete, all.<br /><br />Rememdium: cure, remedy, medicine.<br /><br />Mortuus: dead, deceased, passed away, departed.<br /><br />Contego: to cover, shield, protect, defend, to conceal<br /><br />Alacritas: rapidity, quickness, animation, sharpness, eagerness.<br /><br />Victus: victuals, sustenance, living, manner of life, nourishment, food.<br /><br />Tribuo: to give out, divide, allot, assign, grant, give, allow.<br /><br />Tendo: to direct, try, attempt, stretch, tend, extend, present, give, to strive, heighten.<br /><br />Socius: partner, companion, sharing, comrade, associated, allied, ally, fellow.<br /><br />Valde: Intensely, strongly, very much, powerfully, extremely, greatly, exceedingly.<br /><br />Grandis: great, grand, powerful.<br /><br />Grandire: increase.<br /><br />Vigoratus: stout, hale, heale (heal), hearty.<br /><br />Curatus: attention, medical attention, healing, curing.<br /><br />Vires: force, power, strength, might, influence.<br /><br />Telum: javelin, spear, arrow, bolt, dart, armament, weapon.<br /><br />Terra: earth, ground, land, country, soil.<br /><br />Transtuli: carry across, transfer.<br /><br />Persultare: leap, skip, range (over), scour/<br /><br />Trans: across, over, beyond.</div>
