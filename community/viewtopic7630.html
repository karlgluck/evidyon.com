				<div class="content">After making tons of different chars i kinda got bored of simply lvling testchars.<br />So i thought i check out some exploiting methods and botting (with feedback to karl ofc :p ). After making a crappy-bum simple bot i noticed two things:<br />First: It didn't work, lol. I walked around the sq one time, recorded packages with a prog (not commview...). Played them back with a packetplayer and nothing happened. Maybe it was only visual because i had quite some lag while testing, but otherwise good job there! That would get rid of 90% of the botters.<br />And secondly, i noticed the insane amount of packages with which evidyon is bombarding my pc. For a simple walk around the sq with like 8-10 clicks used i recorded 91(!) packages. :O<br /><br />Edit: After some more tests it seems that the bot really doesnt work. However, after sending a loop the client starts to behave weird and it seems to speed up the characters walking speed. o_0</div>

				<div class="content">91 packets?? That's nuts!  Were there any other characters there?<br /><br />Also:  how big were those packets in total?  The # might be high but the average size should be extremely low (on the order of &lt; 40 bytes each)</div>

				<div class="content">Botting is something you really can't protect from happening there's always a way to achieve it the real protection will be how its handled, reported, detected.<br /><br />And yea as of right now the amount of packets being sent to-and-from the server is massive, not sure if this is the way you intend it to be Karl.. I remember just being idle at the login screen and a packet being sent every second, same goes for being idle anywhere in game.</div>

				<div class="content">Yeah, like half of the packets were 12-14bytes in size, and the other half 30bytes per package.<br />I was just a bit astouned about the amount.<br /><br />And ofcourse you can't really prevent it from happening, but if the 'newb' botting method doesn't work the majority of people wanting to bot wouldn't be able to, and that's good lol. :J<br /><br />Edit: Something less related, the server is showing me allways 5 people on even though there is nobody online. It looks like &quot;real player count +5&quot; (or the other four ppl have a chatting disability). o_0</div>

				<div class="content">Huh...yeah I noticed that today, too!  I think we have our first &quot;secular&quot; bug.  Sorry...I'm taking a course on GPS right now and I just learned the difference between secular and harmonic satellite orbit corrections...anywho, secular errors increase over time.  This server has been online for quite some time now, and I think it's hit a snag.</div>
