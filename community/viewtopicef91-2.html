				<div class="content">Everyone knows about robur turei and all those right? so turei give armor robur gives str correct? so why cant there be a spell for every stat str agi cons wis int. and lvl1 would be + 1 lvl 2 +2 etc... and when u cast them you can tell how much u gain from your stats increasing on the stat screena nd becoming green. Also you'd have the icon for each on next to hp just like xenimus and it would have a timer above it  lets say 10 mins.example:
<br />
<br />stats
<br />str    10 
<br />agi   10
<br />cons 10
<br />wis   10
<br />int   10
<br />
<br />now with all lvl 1 spell for each stat
<br />
<br />str    <span style="color: green">11 </span>
<br />agi   <span style="color: green">11</span>
<br />cons <span style="color: green">11</span>
<br />wis   <span style="color: green">11</span>
<br />int   <span style="color: green">11</span>
<br />
<br />
<br />
<br />
<br />10min.
<br />(Icon)
<br />to me this seems to make more sense.
<br />
<br />im not sure how hard it would be to program or anyhting like that but it seems alot more reasonable if u want someone to take your game seriuously you need to make it as good as it can possibly be.=P</div>

				<div class="content">This is definitely possible; however, I think that the uncertainty of Xenimus made it a much more interesting game.  The fact that nobody really *knew* what the spells did, or how good they were, made it more difficult to figure out the &quot;best&quot; ones to use.  The new spell system EJ implemented changed all that and it seems to have contributed to the clone-character syndrome in Xenimus today.</div>
