				<div class="content">Yeah, I agree that spell damage is really low right now.  I'm sure you all can appreciate how hard it is to try to tame the huge number of variables: casting duration (repeat rate), dmg vs. monster hp, dmg vs. mp cost, effectiveness vs. stats, mp cost vs. regen rates, ... etc.<br /><br />As per the other post, I think I agree with Joe that the best course would be to get all the features implemented, then tune.  However, I want to keep this game playable in the mean time so you guys are happy with it <img src="images/smilies/icon_smile.gif" alt=":)" title="Smile" /><br /><br />In the next couple of days I'll release a mini-update with a bunch of tweaks to damage/drop rates and I'll add a new area or two with new monsters.  Tell me what small things I can do to fix up the current system and I'll do it.  For example, &quot;putesco back to lvl 8, lower damage&quot; is straightforward and I can definitely do that.  Let me know!</div>

				<div class="content">First off, the drop bug--why hunt when there's no loot?  I will say though that the new models make a huge difference--I didn't give Marzuku enough credit for insisting on more varied graphics now rather than later, but he was absolutely right.  It looks good enough to go on now that we've got that addition, though.<br /><br />For monsters or hunting areas to add, I would particularly recommend another area between GY and Trolls (make sure Trolls stay pretty hard, then) and an area to challenge the highest lvl of players.<br /><br />I would also very strongly recommend that you fix the relative EXP of Trolls and Monstrosities:  I'm getting significantly more for each troll, but they pose far far less of a threat to me.  If the Monstrosities stay hard (I love hunting them, especially with the lower dmg:  they're fast and tough and dangerous, and keep me on my toes even at lvl 17--not to mention the excitement of having the significantly higher risk and reward of the Spirits lurking around) and have even just slightly better loot and Exp than Trolls, I would never go back to Trolls, even running the risk of losing my precious loot--that is to say, the game would be much more interesting for the higher lvls:  as it is, it's hardly worth my time and the risk, and so I grind Trolls, which are pretty boring.<br /><br />That plus an even more difficult area and another mid-lvl area or two (along with fixing the drop problem) would make the game a lot more interesting in the interim before Beta, and it seems that these are all perfectly feasible for a quick mini-update.<br /><br />That's my assessment, but I haven't been able to play the game nearly enough to give the best feedback.  I can't speak at all to the balancing issues.  What does everybody else think?</div>

I like the concept of having to &quot;aim&quot; an AOE.  I was planning on doing it for a poison-cloud type spell, but this would work well too.<br /><br /><blockquote><div><cite>marzuku wrote:</cite>As you level you get Vis Putesco which is what we have now, bombing everything in the area, but of course this sounds like a powerfull spell compared to the other one and is obtainable at lvl 20 or something? </div></blockquote><br />Sounds feasible.</div>

				<div class="content">I do like that idea.  Now about having cursor effects:  that would actually be nice, especially to get a glow when casting a targeted spell.  I don't know about the radius of a targeted AOE, though--I kind of like having to just get used to it and know its range.<br /><br />Are cursor effects doable in the interim, Karl, or will it have to wait?  It's hardly essential, so it's no big deal if it has to wait, but it should happen at some point.</div>
