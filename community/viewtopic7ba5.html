				<div class="content">I've been talking to a 3d modeler sent over by Serenity (thank you!!) and it sounds like he's what we need.  He will do textured, non-animated models for FREE and seems very willing to work for a small budget.  He is knowledgeable and professional.  But we have a little problem.
<br />
<br />I felt kinda dumb saying our budget was <span style="font-weight: bold">only $15.31</span>.  I told him that I hoped we could arrange something, but I'd like to be able to talk to him with a <span style="font-style: italic">real</span> offer next time, so I'd like to start our first official round of donations.  I have also decided to change my policy on this project to encourage more interest:<ul><li>All donations will be completely used to fund the development and purchase of 3D models</li><li>Donations made now will be applied as game-credits in the future when the game completes</li><li><span style="font-weight: bold">If PV funding develops enough content to replace EJ's completely, then PV will become open-source under the GPL. (~$400)</li></ul></span></div>

				<div class="content">In my opinion I think we should have him do our weapons sketches and such just so Its OUR ideas going into the game OUR renditions of weapons and armors. know what I mean. becuase the game brings it to a more community controlled level. you should give a list of weapons and each person can do there own sketch for said weapons then we have a poll on which should be used. that way its a community based effort. for the people who want to bring the development to a more player based control. we designed the weapons we used they were our Ideas, and even some of the same weapon can be implemented so theres various versions with different buil ins. just and Idea</div>
