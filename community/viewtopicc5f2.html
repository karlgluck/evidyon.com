				<div class="content">Fellow Members,<br /><br />Karl should consider adding some type of Dragon ball system that you can  exchange to gold. Players can go ahead to the website and buy Mystic Ores and exchange them to a special merchant for gold. This way funds would always be available to the developer for better servers,staff,advertisement and software and still have the game free to play. It would be a pretty simple system to add.<br /><br />Example:<br /><br />$5.99   Pack of 3 Mystic Ores<br />$12.99 Pack of 8 Mystic Ores<br />$19.99 Pack of 19 Mystic Ores<br /><br />Per Mystic Ore= 1 Million Coins.<br /><br /><br />Tell me your thoughts.</div>

				<div class="content">I don't believe this is a good idea. I understand he needs funding but I'd rather pay on a monthly basis and then he can add in a option to donate (No, you don't get anything for donating). Games that use systems like these drive me crazy. What is the point of even playing the game if someone can use cash to get to a point where I got with hard work?<br /><br />Just my thoughts on it...</div>

				<div class="content">hmm I agree... a system like that always leads to an imbalance in the economy... if you have someone who can continually pay and gain weath in the game then it floods the game with gold...</div>

				<div class="content">Its a good idea, but at the same time its a bad idea..<br /><br />But either way its up to Karl to choose.. If he wants to make some more money on the side for developing more crap.. Its a good idea.. but if you did it, you'd probably end up geting rid of it later on anyways..<br /><br /><br /><br />If you'r going to do it.. only sell things that are custom content like just for looks, outfits or something, or like the ability to change your character's name for like 10 bucks or something.<br /><br />OR even if your gonna put up multiple servers like usual server make it possible to pay some $$ to change your server to one of the others.<br /><br />But buying stuff simply just for more $$ in game would most likely attract hackers <img src="./images/smilies/icon_wink.gif" alt=";)" title="Wink" /></div>
