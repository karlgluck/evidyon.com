				<div class="content"><blockquote><div><cite>Karl G. wrote:</cite>- We couldn't have shrine-type areas because people would just portal to the end of them.</div></blockquote><br /><br />No they wont, xen had these areas where spells like trans was delayed and creara porta couldnt be marked, which is why a shrine would have to be walked through. unless it got hard and u ported OUT of it.<br />Also Ej had certain spots which you could not mark, Castles, Shrines etc.<br /><br /><blockquote><div><cite>Karl G. wrote:</cite>- No part of dungeons could be &quot;special&quot; because people would just ignore the rest of the dungeon completely--and we would have wasted our time and the server's resources creating them.</div></blockquote><br /><br />Same answer as before, imagine making a Square like hunting ground which you cant trans or port on once you get on it to grind? the reason could pop up on screen when entering &quot;foul magics seem to be blocking some of your powers&quot;, in such a area you would only be able to attack, gasform, run attack etc no trans or porting until you left that area.(this would make it also risky grinding such places because you couldnt just PORT back)<br /><br /><blockquote><div><cite>Karl G. wrote:</cite>- Unique monsters would have to be severely limited in the items they drop and the exp they give, otherwise they'd never spawn for more than a few minutes since people would be constantly camping them</div></blockquote><br /><br />if you had several spots like this in a huge bum world i promisse people would pk for the spots they had(which was fun on xen), though extremely hard and good giving exp monsters should have a timer of at least 3-5 minuttes so that you could clear other spots before returning.<br /><br /><br /><blockquote class="uncited"><div>- All delivery quests, discovery quests (visit these areas, talk to these people, find this shrine) would be pointless since the player could skip everything by just getting someone to portal them to all the necessary points</div></blockquote><br />Well, the idea behind portals for me was that it was going to be high lvl spell, and low lvls would still have to travel quite alot around, and to balance this out a high lvl quest would f.ex have tight timelimits and several spots you would have 2 go to complete.<br /><br /><blockquote class="uncited"><div>- As soon as new map content was added to the game, it wouldn't be new anymore even if the people discovering it tried to keep it secret.  Ex:  One person figures out the trick to getting into a secret hall filled with cool monsters and good loot.  He ports there, someone else porthops and marks the location.  Being a douche this other person just sits in town making portals to the area and everyone now has a mark inside the area.</div></blockquote><br />Thats why Ej inserted a stop action button which closed all portals stopped all attacks, so that you could keep your hunting grounds secret, i even would go out of town before i ever ported somewhere, this was part of the risks and also then  part of alot of fun.<br /><br /><blockquote><div><cite>Karl G. wrote:</cite>- Players far below the level which an area is intended for can probably get anywhere in it without much trouble--portal, trans/trans/trans, mark, die, respawn.  Repeat X times.</div></blockquote> only if you make it possible to portal back to the spot where you died, i say it should be reset, and if you are bothered about low lvls wanting to grind high lvl monsters then just make it so that theres a huge difference between monsters lvls so they die and dont try anymore.<br />Also, part of some of the xen fun was finding friends who had better spots than you had, like isle, lava imps, new wars, old wars, ds trolls.<br /><br />And here are some problems with preventing marks in a dungeon or area:<br /><br /><blockquote><div><cite>Karl G. wrote:</cite>- If you run out of potions or supplies, you're pretty much screwed since you can't get back in without starting over.</div></blockquote><br /><br /> which is why only real hardcore players would be able to do this, and a real good player always went back 2 town after he had 0 pots left, even though he most likely found some pots WHILE grinding, also EJ had some spots which were non markable and non portable, but he also had several hybrid dungeons/hunting spots, where u could not trans but you could port out.<br /><br /><blockquote><div><cite>Karl G. wrote:</cite>- If you die &amp; respawn in a dungeon you have to start completely over, and your gear will almost certainly be gone by the time you get back.  If the cost of accessing the dungeon is very high you just basically wasted your time.</div></blockquote> part of the risks yes, but on xen you could easily if using your brain get a mark near where u lost your gear, and most likely would lie on the ground getting &quot;guild/link&quot; to help you.<br /><br /><blockquote><div><cite>Karl G. wrote:</cite>- Since monsters spawn constantly, there is no safe place to wait and talk strategy (or talk to someone in real life who may be more important than the game you're currently playing).  Since you can't leave, it's basically just a constant fight.</div></blockquote><br /><br />you can alter the spawnrate of monsters at certain hard spots.<br /><br /><br />All you have to do karl is make square like hunting grounds which some spells are not permitted, which is what GH/SHRINES etc was about, you could not Mark inside a shrine EVER, you could not trans fast through a shrine EVER the spell was delayed by like 10 seconds, and if you tried Gassing you would get dispelled and most likely might die if a noob.<br /><br />really like the idea of some intelligent monsters acting wierdly towards certain spells, but that could f.ex be a boss which could pull you back and forth with his powers if you wanted to escape.<br /><br />Also you said people would be portalling in and out of bosses, why just not make bosses inside dungeons where you had 0 mark ability? also i recall that Ej made it so that such spots where useless for high lvls players so they would never waste a mark on such spots.<br /><br />many solutions if you just read and recall past xen.</div>

				<div class="content">Marz, I'd like to summarize your post so you can reflect on what you are proposing.  Take a step back and see if you can understand where I'm coming from.  (Remember, we're on the same side!)<br /><br />This is what I read:<br /><br />Step 1:  Introduce portals<br />Step 2:  Make portals not work in almost any situation<br />Step 3:  Dismiss remaining problems<br /><br /><br />Here are the exact quotes from your post:<br /><span style="font-weight: bold">Make portals not work in almost any situation:</span><br /><blockquote><div><cite>marzuku wrote:</cite>areas where spells like trans was delayed and creara porta couldnt be marked</div></blockquote><br /><blockquote><div><cite>marzuku wrote:</cite>imagine making a Square like hunting ground which you cant trans or port on</div></blockquote><br /><blockquote><div><cite>marzuku wrote:</cite>no trans or porting until you left that area</div></blockquote><br /><blockquote><div><cite>marzuku wrote:</cite> the spell was delayed by like 10 seconds</div></blockquote><br /><blockquote><div><cite>marzuku wrote:</cite> why just not make bosses inside dungeons where you had 0 mark ability</div></blockquote><br /><br /><br /><span style="font-weight: bold">Dismiss remaining problems:</span><br /><blockquote><div><cite>marzuku wrote:</cite>Thats why Ej inserted a stop action button</div></blockquote>This still doesn't solve the root problem: as soon as someone discovers an area, they can take anyone they want to it.<br /><blockquote><div><cite>marzuku wrote:</cite>only if you make it possible to portal back to the spot where you died, i say it should be reset</div></blockquote><br />I think you misunderstood me here: the problem isn't low-level players hunting high-level monsters.  The problem is that trying to make ridiculously-high-level monsters guard an area so that only high-level players can make it in would be useless.  Before trans was limited, I could make it to the end of str, con and agi shrines in Xen at around level 14.<br /><blockquote><div><cite>marzuku wrote:</cite>which is why only real hardcore players would be able to do this</div></blockquote><br />And at least half of the people who will play Evidyon are just not that hard-core--but people like me would still like to enjoy the game.<br /><br /><br /><br /><blockquote><div><cite>marzuku wrote:</cite>really like the idea of some intelligent monsters acting wierdly towards certain spells, but that could f.ex be a boss which could pull you back and forth with his powers if you wanted to escape.</div></blockquote><br />I'm glad you like that, I think it's a cool idea too.</div>

				<div class="content">Hmmm<br /><br />the dismissed problems, well i kinda see your point on why making a huge a$$ explorable map when you can get ported to every spot anyway?<br /><br />1.Well i figured out a possible solution, well here goes nothing, you whom av played wow probably know about cooldown times on teleporting an entire party back to a city, what if we had recall for own grinding and then a cooldown on a portal? this way people would rarely waste a port on any one but themselves, and you would have to actually find spots to mark between all your hunting grounds.(just a thought)<br /><br /><br />2. You could trans to the end of all the shrines at lvl 14? thats wierd there was a teleport delay on every shrine was it not? and some high levels would grind there so i doubt a lvl 14 would be able to trans uber slowly without help.<br />but i dont understand, would you like shrines to be easy or hard? id like em medium hard so that not only friends with highlvls can go but also a group of mates.<br /><br /><br />3.Well, you will probably make areas which will be harder than others, im sure you could make zones with different skill requirements, im the kinda type that turns of game sounds and turns on Neoplasma on my headphones and just grind Red SQ, some will be of the types that grind mobs carefully with invis. just differ the difficulty of zones to attract more and more players.</div>

				<div class="content">WoW Cooldown system makes it so that if you use certain spells they will all have a Timer set which counts down until it is usable again, f.ex you could have a timer in the upper right/left corner for that.<br /><br /><span style="font-size: 150%; line-height: 116%;">Port Jumping</span><br />Once again Karl, i rarely ever met any one who would give me their own grinding mark, why? because i was a PK'r and nobody wants to get pk'd just because they gave away their secret grinding spot, but if i wanted to ever have a grinding spot people would also show me the way instead of porting.<br /><br />Port jumping was one of the coolest things XEN had before Ej secured it because of whine from people getting pk'd.<br /><br />Why cool?: You enter a portal at own risk, this could be a port pk, you could find a secret hideout, get lost, get pk'd manually by some one on the other side, or pk them for letting the portal stay open.<br />Why not cool?: Some people are afraid of pk'rs and seem to be whiny b!tches. A Portal is a Portal it is logical that any one could use such a thing? its like a doorway, if i could enter karl and rabit could probably aswell? until i closed it of course, get it?  <img src="images/smilies/icon_smile.gif" alt=":)" title="Smile" /> <br /><br />Games get better with great risks, some people might get sad over the fact that others enjoy jumping into their ports, but if you really want to be sure nobody jumps into your portal, then you can safely leave town and port out, and close the portal behind you like many high levels did.<br />i myself port pk'd etc, and i gladly shared my marks with those who willingly wanted to enter my portals, which was a great way of getting allies and gear.<br /><br />Still i suport the idea of having dungeons and some maps un markable or else people will do as karl said, just portal to the end boss.<br />If you make some squares delayed when it comes to transing, and insert smart mobs dispelling gasform, then high lvls would have to walk through with low levels, or the low lvl would die.<br /><br />Lets say a portal is like a pandoras box, you never know what will come out of opening it.<br /><br />anyway, i dont actually like recall, if we just had 0-9 marks and the stuff we have been talking about then i would be happy.<br /><br /><span style="font-size: 150%; line-height: 116%;">&quot;Suport of rabits post&quot;</span><br /><br />We should have some hard bosses, but they should be hard and not super long lasting so that you blow an entire life of grind on one, just a boss that easily can take you down if you suck.</div>

WoW made it so that the game was simple to learn but hard to master. | We've got this to a degree  <img src="images/smilies/icon_biggrin.gif" alt=":D" title="Very Happy" /> <br />3. Popular old xen/WoW had portals/summoning/extremely fast mounts | We wont have mounts, wont have summoning and lets hope some one doesnt f*ck up &quot;Portals&quot;  <img src="images/smilies/icon_evil.gif" alt=":evil:" title="Evil or Very Mad" /> <br /><br />If the map is as big as karl says it is, then people will have to slowly explore the game and mark as they progress, but you cant create a game that is going to still be explorable at max levels, to some degree people will learn the map anyway and then they will quit cause it takes to long to travel where you need to go.<br /><br />POINT: if the map is as big as karl says it is, then people cant simply just mark whithin a certain grinding spot, they will have to mark between several nice grind spots and travel, by this point people will still be exploring the best possible solutions for marks etc, and if you have enough important towns most the marks will go to something equivalent of a t7/t7ds which has portals to other towns.<br /><br />i still hate the whole idea of recall, it is a means of escaping with no trace which will make every one a warlock.</div>

				<div class="content">We have not yet had a full discussion of portaling in a dev meeting.  Right now all we're doing is thinking of problems and potential solutions (whether whole or partial).  Nothing has been decided yet, and when we do sit down to make decisions, we will be reading through this thread to make sure we're accounting for all the concerns here expressed.  And since <span style="font-weight: bold">this is alpha</span> any decision we do make can be easily changed if there's a good reason to change it.<br /><br />Marz, what Richard advocates isn't asskissing, but simple good faith.  Such good faith is a necessary prerequisite for any serious discussion, of games or otherwise.  If you can't grant us that much, then we can't really have these public discussions of design questions.</div>

				<div class="content">Marz, it seems absurd to me to blow up over ideas that get thrown out in a discussion of possible ways to make portaling work.  It seems particularly absurd to get worked up to the point of insulting others.  What was a pretty thoughtful and helpful discussion up till you responded to my little thought up there was derailed by a temper-tantrum.  That's absurd.<br /><br />I'll go through and give my thoughts on ports themselves later tonight or tomorrow.  There is some good stuff in this thread that I'll be thinking about, and maybe if I can offer a comprehensive treatment of the issue we can talk about these things without such misunderstandings and nonsense disagreements.</div>

BUT bearing in mind this is ALPHA these thing should be discussed with imagination (which you seem to find hard to do) and not shot down in sequence. That said, I do think that recall needs to be self only whether it is instant or through a portal. But in my personal preference I would rather see people in a fantasy world casting self open portals other than disappearing super quickly off screen. And maybe if someone stands in a players recall portal a message saying (or similar) &quot;You are not free to enter, Not Welcome to Pizza Planet&quot; <img src="images/smilies/icon_razz.gif" alt=":P" title="Razz" /> sorry had to get a Toy Story themed joke in there haha</span><br /><br />Thanks all</div>

				<div class="content">Did I miss something? LoL this is an XEN remake people, why are you trying to make it like WoW?<br /><br />The whole reason this project is here is to recreate the old Xen-Game-Play and from what I'm reading even Richard want's to get rid of the portal system that was created around Xenimus (which was A great system)<br /><br />and there was NO problem with it, absolutely nothing. So why is there arguing about what kind of portal system we should use when Xenimus's itself was the bomb.<br /><br />I just can't get it through my mind how people would even imagine that anything different would feel like Old Xenimus..</div>
