				<div class="content"><span style="font-size: 90%; line-height: 116%;">Karl,<br /><br />Alongside my current workload in life, I am running a very small dropshipping project in my after hours time. As you know I am wholeheartedly following the project to the maximum I can possibly, and now that things seemed to have started to calm down a little recently this has left a lot more spare time for thoughts and considerations for the project.<br /><br />As I mentioned my small after hours dropshipping project I have been running roughly ranging profits between £15-£27 a week. Yes, it is very very small in comparison to full time businesses but this is money made from very little time out of hours and stems from my creativity. So what I am trying to gear this towards is how I can mix this after hours creative process I have running after business, into my commitments and dedication to the Project which I will always call Volucris (i'm sorry! <img src="./images/smilies/icon_razz.gif" alt=":P" title="Razz" />).<br /><br />What I am proposing Karl is that, I will actively donate a fluctuating 20% rate of my after hours work based on the profits made for each week in my continuing efforts to support your developing Karl and everyone in the community, regardless of how &quot;inactive&quot; as such I may have been of recent which I have spoken about.<br /><br />Please can we discuss this or throw me a portal of some kind for this proposed donation scheme to go through <img src="./images/smilies/icon_razz.gif" alt=":P" title="Razz" /><br /><br />I would be keen to hear from you <img src="./images/smilies/icon_smile.gif" alt=":)" title="Smile" /><br /><br />All the Very Best,<br />Richard</span></div>

				<div class="content">Hey Richard! It's great to hear from you, I'm glad the real world hasn't completely taken you away <img src="./images/smilies/icon_smile.gif" alt=":)" title="Smile" /><br /><br />Thank you very much for updating the model digging collection.  The armor models look good, as do the character meshes.  I think you're right that EJ used the skeleton from that set; however, I also think that the author just steals his models and rebundles them.  If you look on the last page, &quot;bezerka&quot; was taken from The Game Creator's DarkMATTER December 2006 free models collection.  It's the same mesh I use for the golems right now <img src="./images/smilies/icon_smile.gif" alt=":)" title="Smile" /><br /><br />I'm very flattered that you would like to donate to the project--all donations will go right toward adding content &amp; buying servers, we're at the point where this stuff can really go forward!  Send me an email and we can discuss this further (<!-- e --><a href="mailto:karlgluck@gmail.com">karlgluck@gmail.com</a><!-- e -->)<br /><br />Karl</div>
