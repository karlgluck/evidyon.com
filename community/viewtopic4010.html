				<div class="content">Hey Nirvana,<br /><blockquote><div><cite>Project Volucris Timeline Wiki wrote:</cite><span style="font-size: 150%; line-height: 116%;"><span style="font-weight: bold"><br />August, 2008 - Future</span></span><br />Week 3: Private alpha server goes live. This server will be used mostly to identify and debug technical issues: making sure the program runs on all types of hardware, checking network latency, maximum character capacity, potential methods of abuse, etc. This is private for two reasons: (1) the server will not be set up to handle a huge number of players and I don't want people to get frustrated by not being able to log in, and (2) the game won't have any of the storyline, economy or character advancement yet. These will be available in the beta.<br /><br /><span style="font-weight: bold"><br /><span style="font-size: 150%; line-height: 116%;">December, 2008 - Future</span></span><br />Week 1: Public beta begins </div></blockquote><br /><br /><br />Firstly its always nice to see new faces well messages from new people around here, we are collectively fond of new members to the community. Just to let you know I may not have been as active as usual of late, but I still understand the nature of the beast! - The private server released in 2 weeks time will be for players or members of the community that have been shedding some thoughts into the project for some time, this is to ensure that Karl is not insecure about the way things will look and how things will be for a few months.<br /><br />Players who have been around for quite some time adding new systems into the game, models, and even maps and areas etc. These types of players will not mind how the game feels looks or plays, and will be biased in a good way towards the developments. whereas new coming members at this point who do not become an active member shedding any support will be biased against what they can compare the game to at its current stage. which is what Karl would like to steer away from (which is understandably th right decision as aways).<br /><br />So depending on your stance within the community will decide whether or not you fit into which of those categories, if you are not apart of the private server then don't be downhearted, get involved lots shed your support more than ever, and soon enough you will be shining as an active supported which will come with great rewards.<br /><br />I Hope This Helps,<br /><br />Richard.</div>

				<div class="content">So the actual date is going to be August 26th.  I know this is in the last week of August...but there's a mitigating factor.<br /><br />I'm actually taking a short vacation this summer!  I'll be in Canada &amp; away from the internet entirely from the 20th until then...so if I were to release before I go, chances are something would need to be fixed or the server restarted and nobody would be around to do it.  So I'll release right when I get back!<br /><br />August 26th people!</div>

				<div class="content"><blockquote><div><cite>Necromadon wrote:</cite>Who will get to join the test server? Those who've donated?</div></blockquote><br />Probably. Though considering the number of people in these forums, it could probably be opened to anyone here who wants in, and then x number of spots for people who sign up the day of release?<br />This is pure speculation, though. Its up to Karl. <img src="images/smilies/icon_razz.gif" alt=":P" title="Razz" /></div>
