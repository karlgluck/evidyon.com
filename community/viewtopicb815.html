				<div class="content">I know melee classes are still under work just thought it would be helpful if all those who rolled a fighter had a place to post some suggestions..<br /><br />-Gaining exp with a fig is sllloowww<br />-Strength stat appears to be a little weak<br />-Would be cool to see dual wielding and a larger spin radius</div>

				<div class="content">Strength definetely should have more effect for the damage output.<br />My lvl21 warrior with 38 strength needs the same amount of melee/spin hits to kill a monstrosity as a much lower char with only 20 strength. Hitting a testchar also showed not much of a damage difference, str could need quite a boost :s<br /><br />(with more damage-output levelling would also become easier, generally spin works fine with me).</div>

				<div class="content">Thx man, it's <span style="font-style: italic">much</span> better now.<br />Now my lvl21-38str-dude two-spins the master grendans, but that should be fair considering that the char has low cons and can die quite quickly there.<br />I gotta test it with/on other players later to see how that works out now.</div>

				<div class="content">I'm glad <img src="./images/smilies/icon_biggrin.gif" alt=":D" title="Very Happy" /><br /><br />The benefit is exponential, by the way.  Oh, and it's multiplicative--if you use a weapon with 1 pt more damage, with your strength you'll probably do 40 pts more/hit.</div>

				<div class="content">Well, after further testing it seems maybe even a bit overpowered in pvp atm, i can two-hit myself to death (with 738hp and 240 armor), and i pretty much one-hit every char with less then 300 hp (then again the char is basically a all-str build; 38-20-17-10-10).<br />I know tweaking stuff like that is the annoying, long-winding part of creating such a game. Some input of other warriors/thieves/pallys might help more here.</div>
