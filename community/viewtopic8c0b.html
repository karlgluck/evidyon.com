				<div class="content">We all know eventually there will be a new expansion and/or upcoming full release of the game. I'm not curious as to when but I was thinking, maybe we could get a preview of the &quot;patch notes&quot; to pump us up for what is going to be released and how we can prepare for it.<br /><br />Example: how many new zones, stat changes, mob changes, gear edits, etc</div>
