				<div class="content">So I finally got around to registering here. What a lazy schmuck I am.
<br />
<br />First off, major props to everyone involved; things are looking awesome so far!
<br />
<br />I was wondering if anyone knows EJ's views on this project. Not that I particularly <span style="font-style: italic">care</span> what he thinks, but still, I'm a nosy bugger.
<br />I also saw the post requesting weapon models. Though I'm not very good with 3D modeling (<span style="font-style: italic">I wouldn't be able to create a polygon with a machine from Polygons-R-Us</span>) I could probably cough up som sketches if I find the time.
<br />
<br />Very much looking forward to see how things develop <img src="./images/smilies/icon_biggrin.gif" alt=":D" title="Very Happy" />
<br />I just got my paycheck so I might be able to donate tomorrow, just have to decide on how much and what marks I want to leave in the game.
<br />
<br />... I'm thinking of herrings.</div>

				<div class="content">Yeah I've asked EJ about licensing his content but he hasn't gotten back to me.  I'm going to email him again when we have more to show that we're actually serious and actually in a position to compete with his game.  Either he will allow us to license his content for the mean time, or we'll just develop our own and eventually take all of his customers.  His decision, really, being that once all the content is replaced, the names are changed and the feel is developed, our game will be nothing like current Xenimus.</div>
