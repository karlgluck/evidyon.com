				<div class="content">The short story is, he can't/doesn't want to.  The longer story is that I have decoded the MDJ format and could just up and *use* the models without his permission, since the EULA has no restrictions on doing so, and the game download doesn't mention assets at all.  However...that's pretty jerks, and I think I can do better anyway.<br /><br />Here's the full scoop.<br /><br /><br />To: E. J. Thayer<br />From: me<br /><br /><blockquote class="uncited"><div> Hello Mr. Thayer,<br /><br /> I'd like to hear your thoughts regarding the potential for me to license the use of Xenimus's content for use by Project Volucris.<br /><br /> I'm in a position now to tell you that I have received much more support than previously anticipated for this game, and am prepared to offer substantial monetary compensation for this right.  As I detailed before, this would involve any combination of up-front or installment payments, in addition to the necessity of downloading Xenimus from your servers and having it installed to play Project Volucris as long as the game uses the content.<br /><br /> In good faith, here are some gameplay videos demonstrating what I have developed thus far:<br /> <!-- m --><a class="postlink" href="http://video.google.com/videoplay?docid=-5392195941608692353&amp;q=volucris">http://video.google.com/videoplay?docid ... q=volucris</a><!-- m --><br /> <!-- m --><a class="postlink" href="http://video.google.com/videoplay?docid=-2008301378157381322">http://video.google.com/videoplay?docid ... 8157381322</a><!-- m --><br /> <!-- m --><a class="postlink" href="http://video.google.com/videoplay?docid=-141260286402602682">http://video.google.com/videoplay?docid ... 6402602682</a><!-- m --><br /><br /> These videos include one of basic, functional gameplay; another of the stats/inventory screen and a third of the map editor.  All of the programs are fully functional at this point, and I simply need content to begin fleshing out the game.<br /><br /> I see two potential paths to take from here.  Should PV (Project Volucris) be officially able to use some of Xenimus's content as outlined before, you will be personally compensated and, by proxy, the popularity and download frequency of your game will be boosted.  This has the potential to provide a dual increase in your income.  Alternatively, I can invest the money into hiring local 3d modelers--and believe me, Cornell University has no shortage of undergraduate 3d modelers who need a little extra cash--but this route is not beneficial for either of us.  My models would take a little longer to get developed, and PV would become Xenimus's competitor instead of ally.<br /><br /> As I mentioned in a prior email to you, so long you did not sign a contract explicitly restricting your ability to sublicense the models you bought, there is no legal issue in doing so.  Models purchased individually from websites may be restricted, but it would not be a problem to exclude those from our agreement.<br /><br /> Please give my proposal ample consideration, and reply when you have reached a decision.  I look forward to hearing from you.<br /><br /> Sincerely,<br /><br /> Karl Gluck<br /> <!-- e --><a href="mailto:karlgluck@gmail.com">karlgluck@gmail.com</a><!-- e --></div></blockquote><br /><br />From: E. J. Thayer<br />To: me<br /><br /><blockquote class="uncited"><div>I'm honestly impressed at what you have there so far. Looks like you<br />have done some real programming and know what your doing. I cannot<br />however give you permission to use the 3d models or textures in Xenimus.<br />The people that I have purchased 3d models and textures from do have<br />written in their agreements that I am now allowed to give out or resell<br />their material. I can only distribute things with the game for use with<br />Xenimus.<br /><br />My suggestion is simple, write your own game. You obviously have some<br />good talent and from what I hear you have some people helping you out.<br />Be creative and create a game.<br /><br />From a legal stand point you run the risk of getting sued by companies<br />that have sold me models or textures. That kind of risk just is not<br />worth taking.<br /><br />There is another path from this point also. You and your team could help<br />me work on FP. I will let you in early on what I plan on doing with FP<br />very soon. I'm currently upgrading the map maker and game to DirectX 9<br />with pixel shaders for the terrain engine so I can do several layers of<br />multi texturing. The 3d modeling tool that I use to create models is<br />already converted. The plan is simple. I will post jobs on the website<br />that anyone can offer to do. For example:<br /><br />New small cave dungeon  - $250<br />New large crypt dungeon - $500<br />New small town (8 - 10 houses) - $200<br />Capital city layout of streets - $200<br />3 part chain quest - $150<br />kill quest - $50<br /><br />Then what people would do is email me requesting to do one of those<br />jobs. Once they are done and the work is approved the game owes them the<br />amount of money the job was worth at a rate of 5% of the profits until<br />they have been paid off. I will keep a database of who has worked on the<br />game and how much the game owes them. So if/when the game becomes<br />profitable they start to get paid. This gives everyone a vested interest<br />in seeing the game succeed.<br /><br />I think this is a cool idea to develop FP.<br /><br />Thats enough writing for now. Talk later.</div></blockquote></div>

				<div class="content">It really isn't all that bad.  Models aren't that hard to come up with anyways, it's mainly the textures that make the models.  If there were a group of people, some dedicated to modeling, and the other to textures, I'm sure we can come up with some pretty neat things at a decent pace.</div>
