				<h3>A Theory About Freezing</h3>
				<div class="date"><img src="styles/prosilver/imageset/icon_post_target.gif" width="11" height="9" alt="Post" title="Post" />Posted: <strong>Sun Oct 18, 2009 12:11 am</strong></div>

				<div class="content">I tend to freeze a lot while playing my adept.<br />I realized that when I switched to my warrior to level him up, that I managed to go 3 levels 15-18 without a single freeze or lag out.  Also I still have not had any problems with my warrior.<br />This is just a theory but, could it be that my adept is freezing all the time because of spells and some memory problem?<br />I usually freeze when casting the return home spell, astrum magnus, or when another adept goes by my screen.<br />I was hunting with Happy Ending at trolls and it would seem like everytime he went by my screen and did a spell, my screen would freeze and lock up my computer for several minutes, even in windowed mode.  Sometimes when I would log back in, my character would almost automatically die from putting me back at trolls or would just spawn me at the square.  Most of the time I have gotten lucky and been spawned at the square when logging back in.<br /><br />I also started a new adept character and was hunting with some other new characters, but we all kept lagging out.  The other 2 characters were adepts aswell.  We could run around on the same screen and be fine but, when it came to fighting and spell casting we didn't have much luck, and were all having problems.</div>

				<div class="content">In addition to this, I have noticed:<br /><br />1) I NEVER freeze when I am alone on the screen.  For example I can keep hunting trolls without freezing if no one is there with me<br /><br />2) I only freeze when someone is around me<br /><br />3) It seems like I freeze the second the other guy around me casts some sort of spell.  I am unsure what spell it is though.<br /><br />It seems to be consistent with what Part-Time Modeler said. Hope this helps too.</div>

				<div class="content">I have had this happen to me once. <br />I lagged out in trolls center chamber, and when I logged back in, I was surrounded in darkness.<br />I took a video of the character breakdancing, not really, but stuck in one spot, in the dead position, and only able to spin around.<br />Happy Ending told me to return home, so I casted Reditas Dorma (not sure of the spelling) and all was back to normal.<br /><br /><a href="http://tinypic.com/m/5zjtpg/1" class="postlink">Breakdance Video</a><br /><br /><br /><img src="../../i36.tinypic.com/hsls8k.jpg" alt="Image" /></div>

				<div class="content">Ok so here is more info about the freeze bug.  It was just me (Warrior) and a hunter duking it out at square, and when we both started healing I froze.  I was casting just the regular mederi, and he was casting the green one or maybe using potions.  But I think that is what caused me to freeze.</div>
