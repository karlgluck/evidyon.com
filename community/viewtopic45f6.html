				<div class="content">I'm not sure if it's been expressed or the topic has been covered but the serious amount of lag the past couple days is ruining the game experience.  I'm 20+ and can't even level in ogres due to lag killing me multiple times.  I've had over 30k debt due to lag.  Can someone enlighten me as to why there is so much when 2+ are on and when is it going to be fixed?</div>
