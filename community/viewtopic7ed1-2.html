It's all equal, you just have to put some time and thought into it.<br /> <br />But there NEEDS to be rare items in game to make it feel like Xen, Hell most of the time when I was playing Xen, I was PVPing, and the only reason I (personally) PVP is for the drops, and if gear isn't rare and it's all just basic.. What's the point?<br /><br />Plus++ It gives people a reason to get to a higher level.. Just to be able to find awesome stuff, and improve your char.</div>

				<div class="content">Actually, the new item set we're working on will include both level and stat requirements.  And &quot;epic&quot;/&quot;legendary&quot;/extra-rare/whatever-the-####-you-want-to-call-them items!  But don't worry Marz, the concern you articulate is very much on our mind--we aren't making the game entirely dependent upon items, although they will be important.  More info later:  I'm working on a long post to give more complete information about the item set and development in general, which I'll probably put up tomorrow.</div>
