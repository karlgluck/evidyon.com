				<div class="content">It's not the point i got your wand, as we all know items in this game are fairly easy to come by.<br /><br />Ive been playing for like 2 days, And I'm lvl 19. And yes i have bejeweled rings.<br /><br />You were crying and whining saying &quot;you are reporting MY char to karl&quot; and going to get ME fixed.<br /><br />As if i had to be bugged to own you, so yes, you actually were crying.<br /><br />You have alot of nerve saying someone ELSE is bugged when everyone knows at the moment beam does WAY too much dmg and is being fixed.<br /><br />I find it so pathetic you're bragging about gear, honestly, this game is in alpha. I share everything i get if i have doubles with the other people who play and need them.<br /><br />It allows them to compete with you for levels, like me and my friend amor, we are almost head to head in level and its a constant motive to keep leveling.</div>

So i waited until you stopped and attacked you.<br /><br />Seriously just stop, theres no point in arguing anymore, you got caught crying like a little girl because you got dropped.</div>

				<div class="content">Funny considering i have absolutely no problems with anyone unless they start stuff with me first, which you did. I gear up all the noobs i see, and even help them levels as much as i can. I have a few pals that are lvl 25 aswell.<br /><br />Also for the &quot;call me for help&quot; thing.<br /><br />Well after our little pvp session we just had, I'm sure you know how that will turn out.<br /><br />I really don't have a problem with you anymore. We were acting very nice to eachother in game, testing and such. And i appreciate the couple bejewled rings and helmet of spite and gloves you dropped me. I'm a really cool person dude if you get to know me, you can pretty much ask anyone. You just seem so cocky and arrogant. And after I've killed you in fair Pvp's 1on1 2x on each of your chars, (even though you said you'd own me) you still looked for excuses saying &quot;I could own you, just when theres a reset&quot;. I'm thinking dude..come on, just say nice fight and move on. Ever think the way i pvp could have ANYTHING to do with how i can kill you? <br /><br /><img src="http://i44.tinypic.com/fjgv37.png" alt="Image" /><br /><br /><img src="http://i39.tinypic.com/aovvq1.png" alt="Image" /><br /><br /><img src="http://i39.tinypic.com/2qk8i1k.png" alt="Image" /><br /><br /><img src="http://i43.tinypic.com/34fy0jc.png" alt="Image" /></div>

				<div class="content">Setting a format?<br /><br />And thats fine dude, I'm glad we could test stuff out together too..but why did you claim &quot;blah I'll own you anytime, any day, you suck, your a noob&quot;.<br /><br />It's funny how after you lost, now you were just &quot;testing&quot; stuff.<br /><br />And thats the way I am with everyone Richard, as you know I helped you out on your char, and even if i do pk someone, it's for fun. And i surely don't go around acting like I'm god as Magicos has done.<br /><br />Any extra stuff i have I'm more then happy then passing it on to help people grind in those levels before the gear wipe comes.</div>

				<div class="content">I just play dude, it's a game, ever since i met your char and killed you for your wand when i was 16 and you were 22.<br /><br />YOU'VE been the one out to prove you can own anyone, and shove excuses down everyones throat as for the reason you died.<br /><br />Then you said LETS MEET UP YEAH I OWN JOO I OWN JOO to me on boards, we did and you lost, on both chars. It's pretty simple.<br /><br />All the while I'm not rubbing any of this in your face, until you sit there and STILL continue to talk smack and say someone ELSE is trying to prove something.<br /><br />Just stop dude, you're taking all of this way too seriously, since day 1.<br /><br />What you're failing to realize magicos, the only people who have a problem with me, are YOU and that superlong guy. And why? Because in a pvp i killed you both.<br /><br />I have TONS of people i help out and a few I'm really good friends with like Amor Fati.<br /><br />Not everyone is acting like you are dude, thats the only problem here.<br /><br />You go on these boards posting pictures of you killing people, constantly bragging on your gear and how &quot;no one has ever killed me before besides you&quot;<br /><br />Your the one with the superiority complex.</div>
