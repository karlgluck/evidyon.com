				<div class="content">u mean like this stuff?<br /><br />Crafts<br />Raid Bosses(make them spawn often and drop less, where ej has it at spawn less and drop more is bad.  At least being about to fight a raid boss is fun.)<br />Shrines(the general easy stat shrines, along with super hard +100 hp + 100 mp shrines or something, also shrines for spells.  Like super hard shrines you need to be level X to enter, 1 for each class to obtain a high level spell.)<br />Chests(have them in dungs where you can only find the key to it in that dung)<br />Quests with decent quest log(kills quests,shrine quests, raid boss quests, craft quests, quests for dung keys, etc)<br /><br />or u mean like this stuff:<br /><br /><span style="font-weight: bold">Friends list<br />Whisper function  -- these 3 more or less together<br />black list</span><br />guilds(have 1 leader who can add/kick/appoint 2 marshals that can add/kick)/guild chat<br />party system / party chat</div>

So I don't think you should even start thinking about that stuff yet XD<br /><br />Think about what needs to be done NOW then think about the cool little details, just like a blue-print start the outlines, then so on and so forth  <img src="images/smilies/icon_mrgreen.gif" alt=":mrgreen:" title="Mr. Green" /></div>

				<div class="content">broken that is some good ideas and i like them.<br />the bad thing with the guild system on xen is that if you<br />-kick someone it kicks all or you have to find the exact<br />person and his location.and from a guild leader myself<br />this can be very difficult.any one that reads this post please <br />input what you think this game needs.no idea is stupid or dumb.<br />we really need feedback to help karl out.</div>
