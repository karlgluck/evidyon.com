				<div class="content">Spell FX for the win!<br /><br /><!-- m --><a class="postlink" href="http://youtube.com/watch?v=ZprDgeSeHXw">http://youtube.com/watch?v=ZprDgeSeHXw</a><!-- m --><br /><br />I have only added a few spells that are visible in the video, but here's an idea of how awesomely flexible this system is:<br /><br />- There are 18 distinct <span style="font-weight: bold">types</span> of effects (not just effects--actual TYPES!  for example, player-targeting, location-targeting, omnidirectional target, multi-projectile, etc...)<br />- There are 3 combo slots, leading to 5832 completely unique combo types<br />- There are a (practically) infinite number of visual effects, and each takes less than a few minutes to tinker with until they look nice.<br /><br />I emphasize &quot;effects&quot; in this because weapons and consumable items are used via their effects.  For example, a bow is used the same way as a projectile spell.  The difference comes in how the effects are granted: the &quot;shoot arrow&quot; effect is granted when you have a bow and an arrow equipped; the projectile spell's effect (magic missle or razorleaves, for example) is granted due to player level.  Some complex skills are granted when you have the right combination of items:  bow + arrow + level 15 theif, for example, could yield the multishot skill.  There are also some really interesting skills, like the &quot;hawkhelm&quot; which grants the &quot;farsight&quot; ability.  All this ability would do is pick 5 targets in your current direction:  By comboing this with other abilities, you can multiply their effect (such as with shooting an arrow, you can shoot arrows at the 5 selected targets!)</div>

				<div class="content">Absolutely wonderful! That looks so nice. You have come up with some really good ideas! And since you look like a block now, you should make it so that when the game is finally released, you appear as a block when your on that character, or your admin character... you know equivalent to ej's, Corsix.<br /><br />Oh... and could you do me a favor, could you change my board name to speed3b<br />I dont really want to you this as my alias anymore.<br />Thanks!<br /><br />And great work!!! Im looking forward to seeing more work done.</div>

				<div class="content">Oh my...<br /><br />Everytime you make a release I am suddenly jaw dropped, lmao even when i'm sitting here in the office!<br /><br />Lol I think that would be so funny if your in game Character was a block,<br /><br />EJ =  Corsix<br /><br />KG =  Karl Block (:P)<br /><br /><br />I'm so excited to start using these spells!, im just generally eagerly anticipating the genius outside the box thinking behind the work <img src="images/smilies/icon_razz.gif" alt=":P" title="Razz" />, i'm guessing there will be plenty of hidden sorts of things, mixing certain types of combos with other things, or items granting you certain other things, which will be discovered along the way maybe <img src="images/smilies/icon_razz.gif" alt=":P" title="Razz" /><br /><br /><br />All the Best<br /><br />Richard</div>
