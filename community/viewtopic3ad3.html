				<div class="content">Unfortunately, my copy of Fraps went kaput with my last computer wipe so I can't make movies anymore (suggestions, anyone?) but the lack of new vids has nothing to do with a lack of progress.  For those of you anxiously awaiting PV, here's what's up:
<br />
<br />#1:  Server works!  HOORAY!  You can create accounts, characters, change account passwords, delete characters, and log in and out of the world flawlessly.  I have tried everything I can think of to break the server or make it crash and, so far, nothing has succeeded.
<br />
<br />#2:  Client is fully networked, except for gameplay.  This may seem a bit ironic that the thing that actually makes the game work hasn't been set up yet, but what this means is that the infrastructure is almost all there and ready to be used.  I have some work to do with the message system, but that won't be difficult to implement and I'm more interested in getting some characters into the world first.
<br />
<br />#3:  Multiple clients can log in simultaneously.  Right now, they can't see each other (even though they're both there) but that will change very soon.  I need to figure out how to set up the Actor system, which manages 
<br />things that move in the world but I've got a good idea for how that will work.
<br />
<br />So what does this mean?  If all goes well, PV will be live (at least on an Ethernet) with bummed Xenimus content within a month.</div>
