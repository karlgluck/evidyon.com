				<div class="content">The game is alright.  <img src="images/smilies/icon_neutral.gif" alt=":|" title="Neutral" />  Everything is really disorganized: (no order, safe ground, etc.) I know this is due to the fact that all we are doing is testing to discover bugs or suggest anything we feel needs to change. I saw some other comments saying how it was &quot;unbalanced crap&quot; and how &quot;alpha was more fun&quot; but I know everything is still in the works. There are a lot of great ideas floating around on there, and it certainly is different. The constant player killing got annoying though.  <img src="images/smilies/icon_eek.gif" alt=":shock:" title="Shocked" /></div>

Played an hour, only got to kill about 10 monsters in the whole hour, was being hunted down by people the whole time. Didnt get to test anything except respawn.</div>

				<div class="content">The exterude/extrudere (however you spell it) was a nice armor bonus and something to work for seeing the definition of the &quot;egg&quot; at later levels. Something like that would be cool. Also there were the differences mages/druid like characters having the higher levels, with fighter classes having the maximus as their highest level.</div>

I've simplified a bunch of stuff, chaos is much less annoying, the geosids make sense and I can control monster spawning a lot more easily.  I have finished the spell sets for the Adept and Sorcerer, and the Warrior and Hunter are coming along nicely.</div>
