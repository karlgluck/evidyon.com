				<div class="content">Questline: Facing the Ancients<br /><br />In the begining there was only darkness and chaos, then there was Geona.<br />Geona supported several life forms, some cruel and malicious, some good and righteous but there was still chaos.<br />There were few who would oppose chaos, These few were named the Ancients, they were called so because they were the first of their kind, the first Heroes to explore Geona and fight of chaos for the good of the land.<br />Chaos however grew stronger, and as Chaos grew, the Ancients weakened by it's overwhelming force.<br />Wielding weapons forged by flames from chaos itself, one by one the Ancients turned and became the very thing they had opposed, and the world once again grew dark.<br /><br />Young Knight/sorceror/Class<br />Would you let an old man see the light once again before he wanders into the next path of life?<br /><br />Put to rest the men once known as &quot;The Ancients&quot;<br /><br />And what the new players would have to do is enter some kind of catacomb where there was a room filled with Alpha player copies as skeletons, wearing aurelian plates, spirit D axe, skull swords, wierd helmets, and one after one beat them in combat, each would have a different playstyle and attack style according to class.<br /><br /><br /><br />Doing the quest:<br />Imagine that you were told to go lay to rest the ancients(you dont know their names) then when you come to the catacomb where they &quot;lie&quot; they are awaken in form of skeletons in their former armor, Chaos supousedly gained them long lasting life but as corrupted beings with memory.<br /><br />Suddenly they speak:<br /><br />Rabits idea:<br />Solomon &quot;The Wize&quot; says:&quot;&quot;A Visitor? It's been a long time since we've had a visitor&quot;<br />Maximus Macigos IV says: &quot;It's been a long time since I've snapped somebody's neck..&quot;<br /><br />And Soloman being so.. Gentleman-like would of course be like &quot;&quot;It would be rude of us not to present ourselves to our visitor, before we snap anything that is&quot;<br />(each of the skeletons say their name)<br />Maximus Macigos IV &quot;The Dragon Slayer&quot;<br />Solomon &quot;The wize&quot;<br />Joseph &quot;The chaotic&quot;<br />King Karl &quot;The Former king of Geona King Karl&quot; (he doesnt say his name solomon does, but his nick is held a secret)<br /><br />Then they suddenly attack you all but King Karl.<br /><br />King Karl though just seems like hes looking at the battle and being entertained for the first time in several centuries, You slay the 3 others after an intense battle where they vortex trans beam disrupt etc.<br /><br />King Karls eyes goes red and he attacks you for some time then does some spell and you suddenly lay on the floor dying.<br />King Karl says :&quot;You amuse me young one!&quot; <br /><br />King Karl &quot;Child, you got a long way ahead before the thought of even challenging me should cross your mind&quot; (you, being at almost minimum health now, and almost dead about to end up on SQ)<br />&quot;I will spare your life in thoughts of what future amusement you could bring me when you indeed have grown strong enough.. Just don't die before that time, until our paths cross again... (screen goes black you end up at the castle rewarded for killing &quot;The Ancients&quot; and dont understand why they dont know you failed.<br /><br />Then later at a much higher lvl you are requested to &quot;Slay the Skeleton King&quot; and pop King Karl is back in full force and you get this feeling of &quot;Wow so thats who i actually fought and lost against!&quot;<br /><br />Edited After ideas from rabit</div>

				<div class="content">&quot;Why they are skeletons&quot;<br /><br />The Ancients would have died of old age if it wasnt for corruption by chaos, Chaos kinda Bound their soul to this world, which is why their bodies have decayed but their spirits remain.<br /><br />Karl The Skeleton King will be like the huge bum spider on xen tbh when you finally attack him again, people will die if badly planned and handled.</div>

Work it out yourself, and get people to give their own idea's and tell you what they think could be fixed/added/edited..  Whilst thinking ahead and coming up with better ideas. The forum gives you the time to type it all out, and letting us read it all in one sitting Instead of waiting for somebody wait for the other person to type their next sentence<br /><br />Or he thinks Karl has NOTHING better to do then to watch you complain or give you shithead idea's that you come up on the spot..<br /><br /><br />Or he thinks creating a game is easy.. either way\</div>

Could you suck up to Marzuku anymore? <br /><br />Why does Karl need to be one of these &quot;Ancients&quot; while I'm sure he will log on after beta and play with the players.<br /><br />So unless I see a statue showing Marzuku harassing players trying to test this game or Rabit's statue showing him groveling at Marzuku's feet I'm against it.</div>
