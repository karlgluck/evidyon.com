				<div class="content">Well, to put it simply, it's a touchy beast.  I'm doing my best at the design stage to make sure I don't have to overhaul this whole thing later because of some fundamental flaw that makes it slow/hackable/unreliable.  I know it'll pay off in the end...but for now, it's just annoying.  I'm going to be taking a break next week, too, so we won't see anything new for a while.  I'll keep you updated.</div>

<br />Touchy is a very nice way of saying it's a bi'tch.
<br />You had better think long and hard about this. Unfortunately, you'll be hard pressed to find a book about &quot;networking&quot; that covers the issues that are most relevant to PV, unless of course, you need the basics such as TCP, UDP, SPX, IPX, IPv4/v6, and so on. I guess UDP/IPv4 are most relevant to PV though.
<br />
<br />Just some basic questions that if you cannot answer, you ought to stop NOW and think about them.
<br />
<br />Is your design targeted for 100 users, 500 users, 1000 users, or more?
<br />What are the hopes for future scability? (PV is going to be popular, right?)
<br />Is it monolithic or micro?
<br />Shard servers to accomidate more?
<br />What is the average number of packets per second incoming?
<br />Outgoing?
<br />What is the average size of outgoing? Does it exceed the MTU? ( -&gt; implications of that?)
<br />What if two users of the same IP address come? (&quot;Dual logging&quot; or NAT for example)
<br />What is your maximum rate of upload? Common ISPs usually provide for less than 64KB of sustained bandwidth. At a mere 1KB/sec of sustained data rate per player upstream, less than 64 players can be acommidated.
<br />How much information must be transfered at log in?
<br />Packet compression?
<br />Variable or fixed length packets?
<br />Encryption?
<br />Spoof detection?
<br />Buffer overflow protection measures?
<br />CPU time spent uncompression/decrypting?
<br />Threading issues/FPS independence.
<br />Endianness issues?
<br />
<br />Right, good luck with all of that.</div>

				<div class="content">Yep, those are issues.  Fortunately enough I've sketched out/solved most of them in the past, so really I'm just redesigning the message structure itself and I don't have to worry about the protocol.  The other great part is that the modularity of the system will allow me to gut the whole network system and re-implement it without changing its apparent functionality.</div>
