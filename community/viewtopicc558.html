				<div class="content"><img src="images/smilies/icon_sad.gif" alt=":(" title="Sad" /> : Every level I seem to lose around 20 health and don't gain any. Willy has 27 cons and seems to only have around 100 more hp then that of somebody with 13 cons. I do not understand the leveling stat system but this does not seem to make much sense to me.<br /> <img src="images/smilies/icon_confused.gif" alt=":?" title="Confused" /> When A higher level character goes party with a low level they both get the same exp. Making for some (in my opinion) very fast leveling.<br /> <img src="images/smilies/icon_question.gif" alt=":?:" title="Question" /> I know wisdom is supposed todo something but I am having trouble figuring out what. I have 26 wisdom and around 850mp (lvl 32), Scallywag has 24 wisdom (lvl 25) and over 1000mp. My damage is less then Scallywags both direct beam and multi shot (which I can understand due to my low intl) so what exactly does Wisdom do? My buffs are somewhat ok but no significant difference to over players.<br /><br /> Peace</div>

				<div class="content">Wisdom should almost completely determine MP...I'll look into your stats and see if I can find anything.  Your hp and mp should never go down; re-equip any +% hp items and see if your hp is restored after you level.</div>
