				<div class="content">I was able to play today for the first time in a couple months.  My characters are all low-level, and I was having a very difficult time of it.  <br />Here are some observations:<br /><br />The low-lvl areas are too big, the players *way* too slow, and the monsters too few and far between, too strong, and too fast.  This boils down to not being able to hunt.  Speeding up the characters would help a lot (to cover ground and to balance char speed with monster speed--right now I can't catch up to the baddies when they start to run away), but the basic problem is that there are huge tracts of land with nothing in them.  A smaller, more populated area for low levels with weaker monsters is desperately needed.</div>

				<div class="content">just a thought. are yall playing evidyon.<br />i mean i made a new account after the update.<br />and didn't have a problem leveling. even just yesterday<br />i made a new character and got him to lvl 4 in less then 5 mins.<br />if you can't find a place to hunt then go south west from town<br />and cross bridge and follow water line u will deffently find some<br />monsters.and if u hit the monsters now they run from you.<br />so just be quick about it.</div>
