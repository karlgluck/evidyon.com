				<div class="content">It happens to everyone, usually when there is a large build up of monsters near by. We'll just have to wait for Karl to optimise the game engine or create a fix for what ever the problem is.</div>

				<div class="content">This is the first I've heard of this!  s it just that your character locks up completely and you can't move?   Or are you trying to cast spells that won't work?<br /><br />If you're trying to cast spells, it's likely then because you need to select target for a spell that you're casting.  Try right-clicking to cancel your spell, then resuming whatever you're doing if you ever freeze up like that.  The combo system kinda dumb right now and it doesn't give you any visual feedback about this.</div>

				<div class="content">A few people have mentioned the unresponsiveness due to large numbers of monsters, however it does happen with fewer monsters around. I would hazard a guess at 6+ and it becomes unresponsive, if you hammer an instant cast spell like heal it wont work for a while, then it will cast a few and then go back to not working. I find archers often make it unresponsive also.</div>

				<div class="content">Yeah happens quite often, you cannot move or cast spells. The avatar simply doesn't respond.<br /><br />Could it have something to do with loading or 'buffering' the surrounding area including monsters?<br />Because i noticed the unresponsiveness (sp?) starts when you approach a area with lots of spawn. When you wait a few seconds everything's smooth again and stays like that for a few screens around you untill you reach the next packed area.</div>

				<div class="content">Yea I just checked out 1.5 for the first time tonight and everything looks better visually but theres some kind of problem causing the &quot;dead&quot; lag..<br /><br />I changed the bit depth to 16 and forced software rendering and that almost got rid of it entirely except for some odd reason when twisted crawlers and monstrosities attacked things became very unresponsive.. <br /><br />Hopefully its a small hiccup in the engine because 1.4 ran seamless and was very responsive for the most part.</div>
