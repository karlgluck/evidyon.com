				<div class="content">There are a fair number of bugs in the game right now.  Karl is working to fix them all quickly, since we can't move ahead from this very limited stage of the game until we've established a stable foundation upon which to build.  So most of these bugs will (hopefully) disappear so fast it's almost not even worth it, but:<br /><br />Use this thread to report bugs.  I will try my best to keep an updated list of bugs here in the main post.  I'll update about once a day.  As a bug is fixed, I'll cross it off and move it to the bottom of the post.  Please be clear and concise in your description of the bug, so that Karl knows what to look for when he's trying to hunt it down and kill it:  the more relevant information you can provide (e.g., what you were doing when you experienced the bug, the *exact* behavior of the bug--the game crashed?, it crashed <span style="font-style: italic">in what way</span>?, &amp;c), the quicker Karl can fix it.<br /><br />If this thread becomes overloaded, I'll clean it up so that we can all stay on the same page.  If the bug forum is unlocked, I'll move it over there.<br /><br /><span style="font-size: 150%; line-height: 116%;">Bugs</span><br /><br /><ul><li></li></ul></div>

				<div class="content">Speed Buff Bug - If a Hunter uses it's Speed buffs and a Sorcerer uses it's speed buff on the Hunter then the Hunter has super fast speed but can hit anything. So maybe a decrease in speed with the buffs or I'm sure you guys will figure it out.<br /><br />Chaos Bug - If you go back and forth through chaos it will end up sending you somewhere off a cliff. I don't know how chaos is supposed to work but either way it gets real laggy if you go back and forth through it.<br /><br />Slash Bug - The move slash is very under powered and only hit like 5 damage.<br /><br />Cloud of Cinders - It's real powerful in PVP. Almost making it impossible for someone to attack a Sorc who is casting it with a fighter type without dieing. Also after the Sorcerer is dead the spell (cloud of cinders) keeps going and does damage.<br /><br />I believe it's the spell &quot;Hop&quot; one of the 1st spells on a warrior doesn't do damage at all.<br /><br />The defense spell on the Sorcerer won't always work.<br /><br />Obvious bugs<br /><br />Some monsters spawn huge.<br />Dual Wielding doesn't look right.<br />The square doesn't protect you.<br /><br />More to come because I can't remember some and forgot to write all of them down.</div>

				<div class="content">Here is a list of the bugs that I have brought to Karl's attention.<br />-One occasion, the ground dissapeared after i spawned. Pics; <img src="../../i32.tinypic.com/2le06fq.jpg" alt="Image" />, <img src="../../i25.tinypic.com/bjdg1t.jpg" alt="Image" />, <img src="../../i25.tinypic.com/efo3zl.jpg" alt="Image" />, <img src="../../i30.tinypic.com/2vjpxth.jpg" alt="Image" /><br />-Some weapons appear to be too large. Pic, <img src="../../i30.tinypic.com/29nxe7n.jpg" alt="Image" /><br />-The dual wield position needs adjusted. Pic, <img src="../../i32.tinypic.com/2njvtdd.jpg" alt="Image" /><br />-Characters can walk along the bank sunken into the ground, but not yet in water.  Banks of water need to be set to land. Pics; <img src="../../i25.tinypic.com/2mdgx7m.jpg" alt="Image" />, <img src="../../i27.tinypic.com/de9ncg.jpg" alt="Image" /><br />-Monster travel abilities.  I had a bog monster attack me from the water, but a twisted crawler was in his line of sight, so the bog monsters attacks hit the twisted crawler, once the twisted crawler died, the bog monster was able to attack me from his stuck position in the water when  I was still in the middle of an island.  Some monsters should not be able to travel through water, with the exception of the bog monster, he is used to bogs and wet locations anyways.  Pic; <img src="../../i26.tinypic.com/30v24k0.jpg" alt="Image" /> <br />-The Hounds sometimes appear really large above the player. Pic,  <img src="../../i27.tinypic.com/2qn0d9d.jpg" alt="Image" /><br /><br />-Um, yeah, I do not know how to explain this one. When at the Southern end of the map from the water, heading east through the trees, something bugs out on me (this has happened 2 times.)  The game glitches and I stay heading in one direction (east) without any player input, the character then starts to sink in the ground and when at the eastern edge of the map, the character is teleported back to the spawn point, but I still have all my gear, so I know I did not die.  Also the bog monster is spawning large at first and, is the bog monster really supposed to be red?  (You may have to manually click to the end if the video does not show the end with the character appearing back at the geosids.  Also, a good portion of the lag is from my computer not wanting to run 2 things at once, i.e. fraps and Evidyon.)<br /><a href="http://tinypic.com/m/5e7tw3/1" class="postlink">Video of Glitch</a><br />I will Update when more are found.<br />-Ryan</div>

				<div class="content">one other thing i noticed with fighter types is that it's sometimes hard to click on monsters if u have a pile. not sure if its because you can still cast spells on things that are dead or if its something differenet but when there's a decent sized group its hard to kill things. do hunters not get any AoE?</div>
