One important step forward: I have devised a way to make armor show up on your character.  I just want to make sure that I prepare for a wide range of future tweaks--items that give you an enchantment when equipped (nocte visus helms), weapons that allow you to use a different attack type (ex. spirit/dirus wand) or give you a new spell (mystic blade, dragon lord staff), propped items, consumables, reactive-type items (that perform an action when something happens, such as max ammys/lsas/redos/bags), and items that stack.<br /><br />It's coming along well.  I'll update as soon as I have more to report!</div>

				<div class="content">Good question! I was actually about to post this <img src="images/smilies/icon_biggrin.gif" alt=":D" title="Very Happy" /><br /><br />So to answer your question: the programming has been done for a couple days now, but I have been world-building.  I want this update to complete enough that you all will have plenty to play with and test as we move into the next stage of this game:  beta!<br /><br />That said, I recognize that this update needs to get out there and start working; so, I have set a date:<br /><br /><span style="font-size: 200%; line-height: 116%;">This update will be released on Wednesday at 7 PM (eastern time)</span></div>
