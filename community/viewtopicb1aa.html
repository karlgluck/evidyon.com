				<div class="content">FIrst off i'm not very computer savy, basically my problem is I log on Evidyon and I have  like 5 second lag, I know it's something to do with the internent because mouse moves freely and all that good stuff. I think the problem is something to do with me being on a college campus, the internet is insanely fast, and I also have the same problem with xen, yet i see kids playing WOW all over this campus with no laggggg..... IM getting frustrated lol, any help would be appreciated.</div>

				<div class="content">That is very odd--maybe you can help by giving me some more information:<br />- Can you see other people moving around lag-free?<br />- Is the lag a jitter or a delay?  A jitter would be you click somewhere, and your character jumps every few seconds to the place where it should be rather than moving smoothly.  A delay is you click, and a few seconds later your character moves smoothly to the right location.<br />- What operating system are you running?<br />- How are you connected--wireless, or wired?<br />- Did you play other versions of Evidyon without lag?</div>

				<div class="content">I can see people moving sometimes, and I do have jitter lag sometimes but most the time I can't move at all, I've tried wireless and connecting directly on campus neither seem to work, I've played past version just on this pc and it worked fine BUT i was on a different internet, what I fine weird tho is I can play Wow and some games just fine. I can't play evidyon or xenimus though.</div>

				<div class="content">It sounds like you are on a tiered internet.  If you're in the states, you can probably complain to your ISP and they'll ignore you, but it might help.<br /><br />Try this:<br />Start -&gt; Run.  Type &quot;cmd&quot;.  In the window that comes up, type &quot;ping google.com&quot; and tell me what shows up.  Then, type &quot;ping 66.96.229.53&quot; and tell me what comes up.</div>
