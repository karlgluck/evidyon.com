				<div class="content">I view the boards a lot but hardly ever see anything posted.<br /><br />I know alpha sign-up was closed and inactive members were taken out, but I was just curious if the game was still being tested/updated at all since Thad's servers went down.<br /><br />If so, can I be re-added to the tester group?</div>

				<div class="content">The game is temporarily out of action due to the server's being down, but Karl has a backup server that will go online if Thad's server isn't back up by the weekend.<br /><br />But yes, the game is still very actively in development and testing, and on track for an open Beta test in the next month or two.  <br />Perhaps you don't see the forum activity because testing forums are hidden from non-testers?  I'm not sure.<br /><br />In any case, I'm sure Karl will be happy to add you.</div>

				<div class="content">It's definitely still available.  I should probably make the &quot;private&quot; forum public, since all of the action goes on in there and I'm sure that makes this place look a little dead to someone who can't see it.<br /><br />Anyway, I've added you to the alpha group.  Next update coming online very soon!</div>

				<div class="content">The forums will need to be reorganized for Beta anyway.  You could probably just hold off until then.</div>
