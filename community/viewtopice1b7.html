				<div class="content">Got comments on my old xen video(making a new one soon) but heres what i got asked by two persons.<br /><br />How many classes are there?<br />Are there magic bags yet?<br />How many items do we lose when we die?<br />Are there Lsa's?<br /><br />Well i think we should implement lsa's for the purpouse of old xen not dying instantly losing gear and being able to call for help in your guild/link(and talking to your victim and torturing him! <img src="images/smilies/icon_twisted.gif" alt=":twisted:" title="Twisted Evil" /> )<br />And implement Magic bags so you dont loose your character traits whom you have grinded with for a while is just smart(so people dont go all nutts each time they die).<br /><br />Suggest we of course re name them, Emerald pendant(green cause i think its the colour of life) Warlock's/Wizard's Pouch(Wizard's/warlock's are considered sneaky and smart)<br /><br />Also, if it is possible maybe release another class? this because you might be able to do some bug testing on it before beta release, and the testers might find it extra exiting since we all have played awhile now and have hit high lvls and are looking for new monsters/classes to play with.<br /><br />Also get some item's fixxed which dont have right stats implemented into them.<br />Example on items.<br /><br />Crown of Talon, has no defence.<br />Spirit dragon axe, no stats just damage.<br />Bone gauntlets, blank.<br /><br />And there's probably more out there, so players who know of items just post them or something.</div>

				<div class="content">Yeah and some kind of  off/on Battle engagement which can make you attack all targets friendly or non friendly.  <br /><br />When the button is off it attacks monsters only, when the button is turned on you attack everything, should be some kind of RED icon for each time you go in battle mode on screen.<br /><br />Atm i can almost not be killed cause of my gear and a sorceror has to do like 30-35 ignis multi at point blank range before i might feel i have to heal, and i kill him in like 3 hit's<br /><br />Yeah and Steals.. jesus steals we need em:P</div>

				<div class="content">Yes, there will be more classes.  I hope to release 2 but up to 4 new classes before beta:<br /><br /><span style="font-weight: bold">Hunter</span> - Ranger/thief/rogue with woodland abilities such as tracking players by their footsteps, spying from afar, shapeshifting into monsters combined with wielding fast, lethal attacks.<br /><span style="font-weight: bold">Leyshaper</span> - Uses the environment for offense and defense.  Special attributes include reflecting projectiles, absorbing/redirecting physical and magical damage, creating illusions (fake walls/objects/people), summoning minions, creating portals, self duplication, invisibility, polymorphing (into objects), phasing through walls and more.<br /><span style="font-weight: bold">Artisan</span> - Crafter class.  Although all classes can add special properties to items and wield them, the Artisan derives his or her abilities almost entirely from the items wielded and is able to see properties of items at a much deeper level.  For example, what appears to be a bronze sword with +1 ability level to a non-artisan, the Artisan may see as a +1 ability level sword that grants him or her the ability to cast Multi Ignis and Whirlwind.  With sets of items equipped in combination, Artisans can get almost any ability from other classes (and some abilities no other class gets!)  Artisans are also the only source of Evidyon's equivalent to the LSA and magic bag, and are able to craft all sorts of other potions, charms and amulets.<br /><br /><span style="font-weight: bold">cleric-y type class</span> - I haven't really thought about this one, but it's needed.  General buffs/healing class.</div>

				<div class="content">well i didnt really like it when ej put in magic bags<br />or lsas. but that is just my opinion. i mean when you know that<br />when you die you are going to loose exp and gear you are <br />a lil more crafty about hunting and more apt to stay in <br />areas that are easy for your level. maybe instead of lsas<br />when you die it automatically respawns you to square.<br />and have gear where there is just a chance that you loose <br />something. and as far as classes. clerics are a must in every game<br />maybe make them the elite mage type withalot of spells and<br />a revive spell and a charm spell.just an idea.</div>

				<div class="content">Well ok magic bags is a no no, but then what about diablo which had an indicator about the whereabouts of your dropped body? that would be cool would it not? <br /><br />Lsa well this is a must really, really liked looking at people trying to beat Demons etc standing overthem by mutatio nimbus etc just made the game more exhilarating knowing some one might get up after they died and try to make a run for it.<br />just think that since its a magical game we should be able to at least have a spell obtained at lvl 20 or something that would let all classes have 2 lives instead of one.</div>

				<div class="content">ok how about this what if there was a gem or potion that you could turn into <br />the geo merchant and it would give you a spell that would let you revive <br />after death sorta of like almus so at least you would be able to get away.<br />i just think that it should be something that not all char have but have to find at<br />different areas of the game. and make it a ndnt item.just a thought</div>

				<div class="content">Yeah, that is like an LSA.  With the Artisan class those will come.<br /><br />To help you get your stuff, though, the geosid will soon provide the ability to teleport to the last place you died.</div>
