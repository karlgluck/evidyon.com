				<div class="content">In Xenimus you level by hunting/grinding. There are too few of quests for comparable exp and your left having to grind for days, weeks, to make a single level. This becomes more of a chore than entertainment at higher levels.<br /><br />We don't have the manpower to program enough quests into Evidyon anytime soon, and even so doing so would be up for debate. That leaves us with grinding being our only means of leveling atm, just like Xenimus. Collectively I believe we all want fast-paced gameplay, instant action pvp, and more higher level / rare items.<br /><br />I believe boosting exp would really help make the game a more enjoyable experience. The pro's? <span style="font-weight: bold">Less time hunting, More time trading and pvping,</span> and could lead to higher level characters (60's - 80's) making for more interesting pvp. <br /><br />Thoughts?</div>
