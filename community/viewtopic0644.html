<br />Also, built in voice chat would be fantastic. (total pipe dream I know)
<br />Right now if you want someone off your link and you cant find them you have to break the entire link. The link screen would allow you to kick/mute linkmembers.</div>

				<div class="content">I don't think implementing voice chat will be easy. There are already free programs like teamspeak and ventrillo that people have used to talk to clanmates for years, so it needn't be high priority.</div>

<br />Its certainly not something we need to worry about for quite some time. Teamspeak should suffice.</div>

				<div class="content">Voice chat will help the game enormously in the fact that we plan on having more things such as raids, shrines will be hard you will need cooperation and you can't type fast enough sometimes or you have to type so much to implement the message for everyone to understand. It just seems like common sense to want to be able to communicate with your partners in a game quicker and easier.  Certainly if we can figure out a way to put this into the game we can find a way to mute people. Oviously the game will start and it will be off because it is an option.  If you can't stand minimal human interaction through voice chat than thats a problem. I have no intention of being a complete bum but it is an apparent facter when making a game and that should be implemented. I am sorry if I come off strong, my best regards to all.=)
