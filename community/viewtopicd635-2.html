				<div class="content">Pretty early in xen, spirit gear had no graphics etc, and it was the best of the best poo. Soon after came Om gear, and a heap of new weapons, etc. 
<br />One of the things I remember was that armor types had a pretty smooth transition value-wise going all the way up to mystic. Then something horrible happened. Even though spirit armors weren't all too rare, getting from mystic to spirit was near impossible. Not only because of the huge value discrepancy, but also because those who had SP armor didn't want to trade it down for a screen full of mystic poo. Because of this, and the addition of ominex, dirus and diabolic armors, I think the gaps in gear rarity should be reworked so that the gap between mystic and spirit isn't so enormous. Basically, I think ominex should be the new spirit armor, and dirus/diabolic would be for the really rich/lucky. Mystic should also be raised in value, as it is currently as worthless as any other piece of armor out there, be it elemental or ref plate. 
<br />
<br />If I'm using the VT system for values, I think it should be something like this:
<br />Elemental Armors - 1 VT
<br />Mystic Armors      - 4 VTs
<br />Spirit Armors       - 12 VTs
<br />Ominex Armors    - 48 VTs
<br />Dirus/Diab Armors- 100+ VTs
<br />
<br />try not to think of those VT values in todays market. It's basically to show that 3-4 mystic armors could get you an SP armor, which wouldn't happen EVER in todays market. And 3-4 Sp armors would get you an Om leather, which would never happen today.  Also, adding a couple mystic armors for a trade for Om leather wouldn't be joke filler, it would hold some value. When the gaps between each armor piece are proportional, finding a good drop rate probably wouldn't be too difficult.</div>

<br />
<br />when you say this, do you mean like drop like tha current drops of fire staffs?
<br />
<br />and ... if you were to say 'mystic would drop more rarely', they should have some insane and unique props to tha rest of the other armours.</div>

				<div class="content">I think skitari is trying to drive up the value of mystic by making it more rare. The truth is, as long as there are better armors available, Mystic will never be what it used to be. Mystic used to be some of the rarest most valuble stuff in the game. And spirit was absolutely unseen. Spirit was the highest tier before legendary items like Mystic Bone Mail, black cloth, and the like.
<br />As long as there are more than 2 or 3 tiers above mystic, mystic wont be what it was.</div>

				<div class="content">I've been checking in from time to time on this project and have decided to contribute.  When Xenimus was new, reflective and lightning were the best.  Obviously you all have to realize that this game will most likely start out the same.  The reason for this is due to the slow leveling at the beggining, with certain people being pkers, and monsters worth fighting kicking your butt.
<br />
<br />It should by all accounts take a few months for anyone to recieve a peice of mystic.  Of course after said mystic has been found it should still take more time to reach it's level requirements.
<br />
<br />Here is my ideal breakdown for gear distribution;
<br />
<br />Monster	common 	                            better than common 	            rare 	           OMG!!! 
<br />				
<br />Rogues - 	leather armor 	           studded leather 	            chain mail 	            N/A 
<br />	wooden sheild/sword/club       long sword/small sheild	             large sheild	             N/A 
<br />
<br />Trolls - 	leather armor	           studded leather	            chain mail	            elven leather
<br />	wooden sheild/sword/club      long sword/small sheild	            large sheild	            N/A
<br />
<br />Skells - 	leather armor	           studded leather	   chain mail/elven leather       Scale Mail/Plate mail
<br />	long sword/haliberd	           large sheild	                            silver sword                Mag mace/short sword
<br />	
<br />barbarians	 - leather/studded	chain/elven	scale                                 magic leather
<br />	
<br />			
<br />wizards - 	chain/elven	scale/plate/magic leather	magic chain/mag elven/mag plate	reflective
<br />	weapons	                mag weapons	                fire staff	                          acid/dispel, maybe lightning</div>
