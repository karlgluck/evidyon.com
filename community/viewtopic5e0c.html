				<div class="content">Every item has a unique ID #.  Each ID# can only belong to one person at a time, and you can only save items to the database if you are the owner of that ID #.  I think ID #s are being reused every once in a while, which would explain the random disappearances!  For example, you have an aurelian platemail with ID# 5555.  If the server generates a club with ID # 5555 and someone picks it up then drops it, the person who picked up the club will take away your ownership of ID # 5555, then will erase that ID entirely (nobody owns it).  As a result, when you log off + on, your platemail won't be saved.<br /><br />That's probably more detail than necessary, but the jist is that I'm pretty sure I can kill this bug once I get my computer back.</div>

What little remains within me of a coder, deep under all these damned languages, appreciates this error.   <img src="./images/smilies/icon_biggrin.gif" alt=":D" title="Very Happy" /><br /><br />And I just love the image of, say, a Spirit Dragon Axe getting replaced by a leather belt. <img src="./images/smilies/icon_razz.gif" alt=":P" title="Razz" /></div>
