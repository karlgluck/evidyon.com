				<div class="content">So guys, i just wondered if you guys whom are out exploring while others work/go to school etc, could post some screenies of what you have explored throughout the land so newcommers might get a hinch of what that is to come when they reach those hard earned levels, maybe this will be an explorer guide?  <img src="images/smilies/icon_biggrin.gif" alt=":D" title="Very Happy" /> <br /><br />-name of monsters? F.ex Blue dragons(gibberish)<br />-some kind of cordination of where the spot is? f.ex  South west, north east etc.<br /><br />will be fun seeing who finds the best spots and coolest monsters.</div>
