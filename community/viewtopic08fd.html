				<div class="content">Well I just started playing this game about 4 hours ago, and I have no idea what I'm doing.  I'm currently a level 15 warrior..  My stats are 37 17 15 10 10.  I just did all strength...  Is this bad?  lol I think this is the reason I still get owned everywhere I go.  <br /><br />My gear is as follows:  <br /><br />Iron Helm<br />Shortsword<br />Iron Kite Shield<br />Bone guantlets<br />Deadman's Boots<br />Damsel's something (It's a belt)<br />Scalemail<br /><br />Is this good?<br /><br />I'm afraid to go anywhere, because I still get owned by a lot of stuff, so if anyone wants to help me out, my name is Hugh Jass.</div>

				<div class="content">All magic-using creatures have been implemented in their primary stages purely for testing purposes and are currently overpowered.  Balancing is, and always will be, a factor in PvE and PvP combat which will be addressed in a timely manner.<br /><br />We're just glad they work =P<br /><br />~Erich</div>

				<div class="content">So do the stats actually have a significant effect yet?  For example:  If I added more agility I would hit and spin faster?</div>
