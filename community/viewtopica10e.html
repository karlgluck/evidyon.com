<br />
<br />Anyways, I hope you guys are doing all right. I've personally been fairly busy senior year, but after AP test, my head should been seeing signs of light at the end of the tunnel... hopefully. I've been the a couple of meeting in the past few weeks and I'm trying to catch up to anything that I've missed over most of the year. Me and Matt W. will hopefully be working together a lot over the summer so that we're popping (I almost said pooping) out artwork like none other.
<br />
<br />As of now, I'm trying to redesign the logo for unseen for the a new layout for the website. I promise it'll be nice, clean, simple, easy to read, user friendly, and all that stuff. I might also be redesigning the logo for born to rule... since we really didn't have one... but yeah, I'll post those up whenever I get a chance to finish them, and you guys can all critique on it or what not.
<br />
<br />Other than that, I hope to learn some modeling fo sho over the summer, so I can help move things a long more smoothing between artists and modelers.. maybe bridgin the gap a bit so that we're not so lost on both sides.
<br />
<br />but yeah, that's my rant for now. Have fun guys~! I'm really looking forward to this summer~!</div>
