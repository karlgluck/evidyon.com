				<div class="content">So i have this idea for an arena server... it is somewhat like Nox.. <br /><br />It would be like Evidyon/Xen except without saved levels and gear.<br />When you log onto the server you create a character, choose race and class, distribute 100 stat points and log on.<br />The map would provide everything you need for PvP: gear, potions etc would spawn on the ground every so often. <br />Multiple maps would be cycled with different game modes such as capture the flag, team deathmatch etc. <br />No PvE/leveling just PvP for the hell of it!<br /><br />Let me know what you think guys.<br /><br />Also TO KARL: would this be easy to implement? i would be willing to help in making the maps and anything else it involves.</div>

				<div class="content">This is definitely do-able...and actually it's WAY easier than implementing a &quot;full&quot; game and is practically finished right now.  I could just focus on spells, items, and combo moves <img src="./images/smilies/icon_smile.gif" alt=":)" title="Smile" /><br /><br />Has a concept like this ever been tested?  It seems really interesting...I just have one reservation:  if this were in parallel with a regular-style game, wouldn't it remove all desire to level and get that next cool spell or item?<br /><br />If you've ever played planetside, that's what this idea reminds me of.  That or counter-strike...or quake....</div>

				<div class="content">Or have it where it imports your characters from the regular server in minus the gear and just have you find gear and pvp to your hearts content.<br />This would make leveling in the real server desireable because your character on the pvp server would be more powerful, but would also give lower levels a chance to fight because they could find better gear there.</div>

				<div class="content">i think the game would attract a larger crowd this way. truth be told: some people just don't have the time to play mmos. this would allow for those people to still enjoy the most original aspect of the game - the PvP system. also, it would allow current players to test/plan certain builds. last of all, for new players who are unfamiliar with xen and evidyon, this would be an easy and fun way to learn the ropes of the game!<br /><br />all in all it would allow for some interesting gameplay  <img src="./images/smilies/icon_mrgreen.gif" alt=":mrgreen:" title="Mr. Green" /></div>

				<div class="content">okay well in My oppinion, If something like this was done.. People would play it, get even more bored and stop playing sooner. Like if you look at any High-Rate servers of Any game there is. you get bored faster. This might be a little different in PV. because its still in the mix of testing and what not. but im gonna have to give the idea Basicly a 60/40.(60 being Aggreeing to this) It would be Fun yes. and in a way Not fully great?  Not sure. Give it a shot XD</div>

				<div class="content"><span style="font-size: 93%; line-height: 116%;">I do tend to agree with Cagen on this subject, I do like the whole essence of being able to find fun in pvp'ing with &quot;Risk&quot;, knowing that you are fighting for &quot;survival&quot;. It is hard to find a balance for everyone to enjoy the PVP aspects, but i think that the Arena server could be developed for tournaments within the game possibly?<br /><br />This could involve team tournaments, Free for All Tournaments and things. This would be an added bonus to the game as opposed to a separable world for different viewpoints.<br /><br />These tournaments could provide the winners or winner, with amounts of in game currency? or actual hard to find treasures. These tournaments could be held on a monthly basis or something along those lines maybe? This could be a communal even which is what I always refer to, things that will get everyone involved together and allow people to get to know each others ways and skills.<br /><br />Obviously the tournaments would be level gap specific for different levels!<br /><br /><br />See what you think <img src="./images/smilies/icon_smile.gif" alt=":)" title="Smile" /><br /><br /><br />All the Best,<br />Richard<br /></span></div>

				<div class="content">I agree, as cool as it would be to instantly have all the spells and high level gear in an arena server, the motivation to earn these on the regular server wouldn't be as high and it WOULD detract from regular server PVP.<br /><br />I'm more against the idea than for it, but if it is something players would like then I'd be more supportive of an arena like Richard suggested where your character from the regular server is transferred over and there aren't any penalties / gear loss to PVP, along with additional PVP featuers such as tournaments, etc.</div>

				<div class="content">what I was thinking would be just a standard tournament where you enter and are put up against a randomly selected opponent. The winner then moves on to the next round, and so on. I'm not sure what the winner would get, but it could be something like a week's worth of a damage bonus or something.</div>
