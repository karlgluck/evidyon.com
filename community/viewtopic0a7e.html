				<div class="content">With classes (almost) finally over, and only exams to study for, I'm finding myself with a lot more free time to dedicate to coding PV!! <br /><br />Now for the news:<br /><br />I need some people who are willing to test components of the game on a regular basis.  I'm going to set up an SVN (it's like a folder that's shared between any number of different computers) where those participating can download versions of the game to test on their computers in real-time--as in, I'll update on a very frequent basis, and everyone involved can give me direct feedback on what works for their computers, what doesn't, and any changes you want to see.<br /><br />If you want to be involved in this, let me know and I'll start setting things up.  I find it's a lot easier to work on a project when people are actively talking about it with me <img src="images/smilies/icon_smile.gif" alt=":)" title="Smile" /><br /><br /><br />So that's that--now for Xenimus.  It looks like EJ's updating Xenimus with a new graphics engine.  Do you think this is going to/should affect Volucris at all?  <a href="http://xenimus.com/GAMEINFO.HTM" class="postlink">Read about it here</a>.</div>

<br />
<br />The tests I'm going to be offering up soon are going to be a lot of very simple technical tests.  I want to make sure this game will run smoothly when released, so I'm going to send pre-release cuts (essentially my debugging builds) over the SVN to whoever is testing for them to run.  This will help me solve problems with the game early on, before they become so embedded I can't figure out where they are.</div>

				<div class="content">FPS: around the 1,140,000+/- 50,000
<br />Just some info on how it runs.
<br />Always runs around 50% cpu usage on my AMD Turion 64 x2 TL-64 @2.2Ghz, 2gb ddr2, GeForce 6150 Go. Opens at about 22,000K mem usage, and drops to around 2,000K after about a minute.
<br />My computer actually crashed about 10 minutes ago and restarted when i was originally typing this, but im not sure if it was the client itself that did it. I check the Log Manager for XP and it didnt list anything except Windows Defender was checking something with CPU-Z.
<br />
<br />Everything is really close and zoomed in, a lot of the times i cant even see what it is rendering.
<br />It doesnt like multiple instances. Probably a good thing though. Causes my screen to flicker momentary, made me think it was trying to full screen, then just makes the existing window all black.
<br />
<br />Thats all i have for now. Ill fiddle with it later in vista ultimate 64bit later.</div>

<br />
<br />I updated the game file so that you'll be able to see all of the pretty scenery meshes <img src="images/smilies/icon_smile.gif" alt=":)" title="Smile" />  Also, I'm taking another shot at the SxS library crap.
<br />
<br />I've determined why you can't run two instances--the ini file can't be opened by more than one instance of the application simultaneously.  This is not the intended behavior, so it's on the &quot;to fix&quot; list.</div>

<br />FPS: 1,400,000 +/- 400,000 (generally drops when i take focus off the window and say type this. When returning to it the fps begin to rise back to the 1,400,000 range.
<br />In scenario mode: 
<br />The following scenarios contain no or a very dark texture.
<br />11,12,13,26,27,35,38,44
<br />The scenario counter also begins at 0/60 and ends at 59/60. I believe the mesh and image counters also do the same thing. Rather then beginning at 1 and ending at their total, they begin at 0 and end at 1 less then their total.

<br />
<br />Argh @ SxS.  I uploaded a new change; try the new version.
<br />
<br />Also, the FPS dropping is completely normal.  Windows tends to reduce the priority of programs that don't have focus to make the one that does have focus run faster.
<br />
<br />I think the texture for those ones is just really dark.  I'll see if I can lighten it.</div>
