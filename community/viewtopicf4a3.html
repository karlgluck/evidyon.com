				<div class="content">ok i have been seeling items on ebay for a year and a half.<br />with no complaints and all positive feedback. so recently<br />ebay instates the new rule that items that they consider high risk<br />they put a hold on your money that you receive. so if you sell on ebay<br />be careful and you have to look throught the help topics to <br />find the items that they consider high risk. and if you receive an email<br />from someone saying that your payment is on hold dont panic it is ebays<br />stupid sh+t. i mean i did over 1000 dollars of sales over the summer<br />and about 500 since and they don't have any records of these.<br />their excuse was that the transactions are automated. so just <br />be careful.</div>
