				<div class="content">I took the quest to slay dragons and on my way i wanted to see just what the quest was so i pressed the quest for additional information only to notice that the quest deleted itself and my only wand of starlight disappeared (expecting it back because of lack of info).<br /><br />Note: Every deleting action should have a confirm button, also maybe add a different line of keying to delete a quest than a normal mouse click which would be the logic behaviour of any player when they want info on the quest.</div>

				<div class="content">I do have to sympathise here, It is a very good idea to possibly:<br /><br />1. Left click the Quest in the Log - Display the notification from the NPC originally.<br />2. Right click the Quest in the Log - Display a delete confirmation message, Yes/No.<br /><br />Although I have to say as far as getting this implemented this quickly goes, I have to say it is really really well thought out and working greatly!. Adds GUI to quests which I think everyone will agree is something that will attract many players and provide ease of implementing more quests quicker than ever! <img src="images/smilies/icon_smile.gif" alt=":)" title="Smile" /><br /><br />Nice one Karl!<br /><br />Richard</div>
