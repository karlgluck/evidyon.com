				<div class="content">I'm going out of town until after New Years, so it's unlikely that I will be able to get online again before then. So...happy 2009!<br /><br />I am waking up early tomorrow to see if I can post some screenies and whatnot before I leave.  It probably won't be much; it's almost midnight now and I just got monster spawn working, so there is probably something I forgot already :/<br /><br />On the plus side, the new system is so flexible that this is the only time that I'll have to implement it ^.^</div>

				<div class="content">I'm baaack :D<br /><br />I've been typing up some loose ends the last few days--you know, applying to grad school, making sure I'm registered for classes, trying to figure out how to pay for my education :o)<br /><br />I am devoting the next two weeks to nothing but Evidyon.  As much time as I can, every day, is being spent working on this game (with intermittent exercise so that I stay energized!)  My plan is still to get the open version out when I get back to school.<br /><br />Things are coming along very smoothly--I found more awesome monster meshes to put into the game, have tested many different spell types, and have planned a lot of the mapping utilities.  Everything seems to be coming together, but I need to get a feel for what you guys want to see.<br /><br />As it stands right now, this version of the game just got monsters spawning in it yesterday.  They don't do anything yet--that's what I'm working on today.  This was a bigger challenge than I had initially anticipated, since I wanted to do it right and make sure it was suitable for planning large maps (which takes a ridiculously long time in the old version) and for handling many different types of monsters (there is only 1 type currently)<br /><br />If there is enough demand, I hope to release the next version with a single adept-like class as soon as I get the melee monsters spawning correctly and attacking characters.  After that, I intend to continue work fixing the bazaar, adding the geosids (since these are absolutely essential to the beta) and fleshing out the classes with more spells.<br /><br />So--let me know what you want to see :D</div>

I would say go ahead and release, though, so we can make sure the bare essentials are working before we add in the other (less necessary) stuff.  And I'm just impatient.   <img src="./images/smilies/icon_razz.gif" alt=":P" title="Razz" /> <br /><br />Looking forward to it!<br /> <img src="./images/smilies/icon_biggrin.gif" alt=":D" title="Very Happy" /></div>

				<div class="content"><blockquote><div><cite>Joe M. wrote:</cite>I'm a little confused:  you wanted to make sure that what was suitable for planning large maps and handling different types of monsters:  the game or a mapping utility?</div></blockquote><br />Ah! I meant the editor (mapping utility).<br /><br /><br />As you mentioned, if anything I'm worried about this version being incomplete when I release it.  It's kinda anticlimactic to have an update that's less functional than the current version (even if what functions is tons better!)<br /><br />Anyway, today I managed to get melee combat working (woot!), fixed a bunch of animation bugs (double woot!) and you can do battle with three new kinds of monsters!  Things are looking good for a pre-release to nail down bugs in all this new code.  I'm thinking I'll get monsters spawning automatically--I'm just testing with an admin command right now--then re-add items before I send this thing out.<br /><br />It's looking good!  Something to toy with is imminent!!!</div>
