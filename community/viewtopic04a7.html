				<div class="content">Not sure if this has been discussed before, but what worries me is that since there won't be GvE, (Don't get me wrong though, I agree GvE was a bad idea.) that if you want to have any kind of Jeloc (If it's implemented) then you won't be able to take part in the funnest gameplay aspect, PvP. Any thoughts on this?</div>

				<div class="content">Hmm, I'm thinking maybe a challenge feature would be cool, where you can challenge people and there are no penalties since they have to accept, maybe even give you the option to bet on who'll win. Then maybe a PvP server where it's all out war (Much like Cons is today) and there are no penalties at all for killing, since the server is meant for PvP.</div>

				<div class="content">There was always GvE.
<br />EJ was just stupid and split the game in half.
<br />There were always people that were full evil, and stayed that way.
<br />You could still do a system of velanthra/jeloc depending on how you played.
<br />Jeloc - you kill the pkers (or those who attack you first) and kill monsters to become more good.
<br />Velanthra - you kill monsters, which make you (slightly more) good, but you &quot;show your loyalty&quot; to velanthra by killing others, regaining your evil status.</div>

Just have Jeloc regular shrine at lvl 30 or something giving you the ability to place at your own discretion a certain amount of stat points (but also having limits) and it is based on boss kills/maybe even player kills. (possibly other variables, but I want you guys to help decide).<br /><br /><blockquote><div><cite>Himora wrote:</cite>Then maybe a PvP server where it's all out war (Much like Cons is today) and there are no penalties at all for killing, since the server is meant for PvP.</div></blockquote>
<br />
<br />This is a great idea in my opinion. but maybe have a reward system such as many other games.  You can gain a certain item for obatining a specific rank in your pvp status. This would greatly diversify gear and make other gear in game more rare.  People who are good at pvp wont need regular server gear when they could just go pvp for special items. Also I would like titles on characters such as when you own a castle.  Maybe your rank underneath your name or beside it.  Pvp should be a choice and you should be able to port to a town where you wait to enter in a pvp area.  Of course there will still be pvp in the regular server for pots, etc.. but there should be a safe way to pvp. If you look there is someone who has made an arena, and I think this could be a nice spot for battles such as these.  We would need to change it up and make more arenas for differnet levels; or use same arena just put requirements to enter. This should definately be considered in this game.</div>
