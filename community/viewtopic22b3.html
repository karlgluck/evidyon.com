				<div class="content">This is my understanding of things in Evidyon. If Joe or Karl, or anyone with better reading skills <img src="images/smilies/icon_razz.gif" alt=":-P" title="Razz" /> could validate or correct some of these that'd be wonderful.. <br /><br />-We spawn into the world of Geona<br />-Nexus is a city in Geona marked by 3 Crystals (like our current spawn point)<br />-There is also the world of Chaos, separate from Geona<br />-The gods observe outside these two worlds, having their &quot;houses&quot; in another &quot;world&quot;, or each their own<br />-Genite is a powerful metal that connects us to our gods and when concentrated between 3 crystals an opening into Chaos occurs<br />-During one of these openings Chaos broke into Geona, created monsters and other undead (are these the Gendran/Verali?), and brought Geona closer to destruction (is this the current state of Geona?)<br /><br />That's it for now! I'm sure I'll have more questions once a few of these are cleared up <img src="images/smilies/icon_razz.gif" alt=":-P" title="Razz" /></div>

				<div class="content">Almost!  We're still working out the storyline, but this is more specifically what we're building:<br /><blockquote><div><cite>kuba wrote:</cite>-There is also the world of Chaos, separate from Geona</div></blockquote><br />Not quite.  Chaos isn't so much a &quot;world&quot; as it is a state of existence--like outer space is around earth.<br /><br /><blockquote><div><cite>kuba wrote:</cite>-During one of these openings Chaos broke into Geona, created monsters and other undead (are these the Gendran/Verali?), and brought Geona closer to destruction (is this the current state of Geona?)</div></blockquote><br />Although monsters in the mirror plane, created during the cataclysm which twisted the world, are powerful beings of magical/chaotic origin, monsters on Geona derive from previous inhabitants of the world itself.<br /><br />The Gendran/Dervali story is still in the works, but I can outline it briefly.<br /><br />Before chaos broke into Geona, Gendra and Derval were two fairly advanced--and competitive--cities near Nexus.  Their inhabitants were hit just as hard as those in Nexus; however, being further from the epicenter they were not absorbed into the chaos but were killed by the event nonetheless.  Travelers, being so wary of the entire region, never even went back to either city to bury the dead; the majority of people who went there were scavengers or thieves looking to pick treasure from the charred remains of what were very wealthy cities.  Many had always heard the regions were cursed, but for some it took an increasing number of travelers disappearing in the region to convince them that something was not right.  The first man to return was so shaken by what he had seen that at first he wouldn't even speak of it.  Gradually, however, he began to tell that the region was ravaged by a great war--a war of the dead.  Skeletons clad in tattered banners gold and blue, the colors of Gendra, clashed with ones wrapped in red and white.  The old rivalry between the Gendran and Dervali transcended the afterlife, and only the foolhardy would dare visit the battlegrounds of the undead.</div>
