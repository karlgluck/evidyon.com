				<div class="content">My own 2 cents:<br /><br />(1) It would be nice to have a visual indicator of some sort on screen, if possible:  it has been bugging me that I have to check my stats screen to see how much is left.  I realize this adds one more thing to the HUD, but it might be worth it.  What do yall think?<br /><br />(2) It does seem to get very high very quickly.  This is probably something that we shouldn't worry about just yet, because it's difficult to tell if the system is inherently flawed until we've spent some time trying to make it work by adjusting the numbers.  If it still seems to have problems after some time, then we can start to think about adjusting the system itself--and even when it comes to that there are a good number of measures that can be taken short of scrapping the system entirely (and I at least think the system is worth trying to preserve).</div>

Actually you are still gaining exp, just not 100% of it.  You work off the penalty with 50% of the exp you still gain.</div>

				<div class="content">As far as I can tell Marzuku you're the only one who really hates the current exp system. Though you did make a few suggestions that might be worth reading if it wasn't so hard to recognize them as suggestions.  For those who might have missed them.<br /><br />  <img src="images/smilies/icon_idea.gif" alt=":idea:" title="Idea" /> Put a physical represenation on the HUD of the remaining exp penalty, much like the current exp bar.  or even an optional countdown of the penalty over the HUD.<br /><br />You also recommended going to the classic system of losing the exp, arguing that it would be easier to work it off.  Think about it this way.  Say you were level 60 and only 10k exp from level 61.  you died four times without a amulet (stupid yes, but likely in some people's case) and gathered an 100k penalty.  In the old system you would have to gain 110k before leveling up, under this system you only have to gain 20k before you level up, and you'd still have a 90K penalty.</div>

				<div class="content">I also like the current system much better than just flat out losing experience.    Once again atleast you are still getting a little bit of experience on top of what you have already made as oppose to regrinding the experience you have lost.  I still think the penalty needs to be adjusted.  I'm not exactly sure how it works now but maybe make experience loss dependent on your current penalty and current level.  If you have a huge penalty already for a certain level you should not gain as much penalty when you do.  <br /><br />For example if at level 20 I die and gain -5000 penalty.  Then if I die, it the penalty should be like -2500, then die again, and the penalty is -1000, then die again and it is -500, so I have a total of -9000 penalty, and from here on in, I will only lose only -500, unless I get back above -9000 penalty.</div>

				<div class="content">i know why im losing this arguement tbh, as i read throughout the posts, people are saying &quot;i never liked losing exp on xen&quot; etc in different forms.<br /><br />you all are semi hardcore pve players, if you really played on the server where people pk'd and really were enemies to the bone, then the worst thing one could do to some one was kill them, make them lose bag, and then make them lose exp.<br /><br />i dont expect some kids to understand this when they probably never did take the exp from other players in pk, and most likely lost it at gy or falling into a pit.<br /><br />also to remind you, the pvp aspects of xen is what made it so cool.</div>
