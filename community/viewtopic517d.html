				<div class="content">Yeah i know I'm sorry <img src="images/smilies/icon_sad.gif" alt=":(" title="Sad" />  I still haven't heard from Thad.<br /><br />Don't worry, I've been shopping around and have found a host for the game once it goes live.   My intent at this point is to go into open beta in January and at that point I'll move to a paid server.<br /><br />Unfortunately...they are rather expensive :/</div>

				<div class="content">Thanks for your support <img src="images/smilies/icon_smile.gif" alt=":)" title="Smile" /><br /><br />My hope is that when I have to start charging for the game in January, I'll take the amount that exceeds what I pay for the servers and use it to buy more content until summer.  At that point I'm really thinking about doing this full-time for a summer--just imagine what could happen then!</div>

				<div class="content">Do i get this right, you plan on making this pay2play in january?<br />That kinda looks a bit rushed to me, i mean that's in about FOUR weeks. Also wouldn't it mean you'd be jumping from a private alpha to a &quot;final&quot; game? I highly suggest a (free) open beta phase in between to get some playerbase before going into a pay2play state.</div>

				<div class="content">I think you're missing 2 months in there <img src="images/smilies/icon_smile.gif" alt=":)" title="Smile" />  I was intending the end of January, making it about 12 weeks away.<br /><br />Now that you mention it, it does seem reasonable to have it be free for a while.</div>

				<div class="content">Your player base in coming from people who no longer play xen, waiting longer gives more people the chance to quit and still try evidyon while its free.  Get them hooked while its free then change to p2p, maybe you should have a goal number of players till you switch to p2p rather then a goal date.</div>
