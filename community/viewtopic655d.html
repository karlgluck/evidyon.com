				<div class="content">Something I was meaning to suggest... I believe he spells are too fast, and some there completely instant. creature's still do a bit too much damage, and you get stuck in them a lot. Makrus has a very little mana cost and is the most powerful offensive spell I have, instantly fries anyone 3 times my level. so yeah, to maybe extend the life of the battle, make players, and monsters do less damage. Anyone?</div>

				<div class="content">None of the spells/stats/damage or any calculations like that are final so damage/speed will completely change. Makrus is a debugging spell made to test out beam type spells, it will not be staying like it is. I think mob damage is pretty alright bar the higher level mobs (master and expert) but those wont have had much attention as not many people can/could hunt them. The bug where you get stuck in mobs has been addressed and is being/will be looked at.</div>
