				<div class="content">As y'all can tell, there are a few small problems with the release.  Naturally, we're working on getting these problems fixed first of all.  I haven't yet talked to Karl this afternoon, but I'll call him in an hour or so to figure out where we're at and let y'all know.<br /><br />As for the problems themselves:<br />* As has been said, try setting the ForceSoftwareRendering flag to 1.<br />* Make sure that you're viewing hidden files (in the &quot;Folder Options&quot; dialogue, I believe), and run the launcher.  It may be having trouble overwriting the current file when it downloads a new one.  Make sure that after it downloads an update, that it does *not* leave a &quot;~evidyon.exe&quot; file in your directory.  If it does, delete the (hidden) &quot;evidyon.exe&quot;, and rename &quot;~evidyon.exe&quot; to &quot;evidyon.exe&quot; ; then run &quot;evidyon.exe&quot; directly, instead of using the launcher.<br /><br />Like I said--I'll post the minute I have more information.</div>

				<div class="content">Yeah, Karl's got it down for testing.  He says he's found the crash bug, and is working on the other bugs.<br /><blockquote class="uncited"><div>[12:25:47 PM] Karl Gluck: so yes the server is down atm, i am going to be updating tonight sometime</div></blockquote><br /><br />Also, we're looking to get a dedicated server soon (ASAP), so the lag will go away.</div>
