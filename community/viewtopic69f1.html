				<div class="content">I'm planning on moving us to a dedicated server as soon as possible.  Only issue is cost, which is why I've been delaying the move.  Once bugs are worked out with this version, though, it might be worth it.  I'd really like to keep two servers running at the same time so I can test out updates before releasing them to the public....right now I have no way of doing that :/</div>

				<div class="content">IF you like, I can ask some of my wow buddies if they have a server sitting around that isn't being used.  Maybe that could be your test server.  SOP - as far as a better heal goes I'm kind of unsure about that.  At the least it would require a higher lvl.  Sorcerers shouldn't have very strong healing magic at all.  That falls to the clerical type characters when partied.   But ya, it would be nice to have better heals on me for tanking dragons easier.   <img src="images/smilies/icon_razz.gif" alt=":P" title="Razz" /></div>

				<div class="content">For what its worth (and whether or not this needs to be considered for balancing, I don't know) it was possible as a knight to solo dragons before the update.  Granted, it required a fair amt of geonite and some creative transing/healing, but it WAS (well, IS) possible.  I think right before the update, without transing too much I could solo dragons with only like 14-18k geonite.</div>
