<br />
<br />i know everyone has their own opinion about which direction this project should go, and how far back in &quot;xenimus time&quot; it should be but there is one VERY important thing to remember. the reason why xenimus was successful early on was that it was extremely difficult to get anywhere (progress-wise) on the game. everywhere besides the safe square was dangerous and if you died youd lose all your gear. people without decent gear and anti-pker items (transies) would hunt in secluded areas and everyone kept track of who is a pker and who isnt. being labeled a pker was like a social stigmata in xenimus. is this what volucris is going to be like? (no mag bags no redos etc?) i hope so! the element of dangerrrr is sadly missed <img src="images/smilies/icon_sad.gif" alt=":(" title="Sad" />.</div>

				<div class="content">Yes, this is exactly how I intend to make Volucris.  What I've found is missing is a sense of attachment to one's character.  The inability to lose good items makes a person careless and is one factor that reduces player involvement in the game.  I hope to bring that back.</div>
