				<div class="content">1.Well we all know that theres something fishy happening, the higher lvl armors you get the lower armor it has, Bone mail has 56 dfence and Aurelian plate has like 34 or something, i think its wrong that we lose armor when we are upgrading. <img src="images/smilies/icon_smile.gif" alt=":)" title="Smile" /> <br /><br />Lion heart breastplate which is uber rare should have more armor and maybe more stats, and yeh the descriptions are very wierd <img src="images/smilies/icon_razz.gif" alt=":P" title="Razz" /> <br /><br />2.When are you going to implement Base damage % +? it was an important part of properties on weapons on xen, and since it is general it means it works for spells aswell as just physical attacks.<br /><br />3.And i know you are not a fan of it, but you really do need gear according to certain classes, a breastplate with magic dmg is a no no, instead make a Flashy <br />&quot;Robe of Chaos&quot; or something which benefits a magic player, though it can be used by all classes it does not matter cause its better for a spell caster than f.ex a knight.<br /><br />4.Also Enchantments on weapons that would be awsome if sorceror could do that, they could buff mates with Fire, frost, poison etc and give your dull weapon a nice look until you logged.<br /><br />5.Get some one to create different models for Wizard hat's etc.<br /><br />6.Still think that speeding up a player's movement is a bad idea, cause it will be hard to pin the player down and kill him if he moves 100 miles an hour, my thoughts are that Agility should only affect your attack speed, and every1 would run at a certain speed.<br /><br />7.Mutatio nimbus needs to be implemented (gasing through tree's and above lakes and over waters until a mage mob or a player dissrupt you)<br /><br />8.Geosid should be a Green crystal you could use as a med wand(giving full hp when used could be restricted to like 70%)<br />and if you want to buy Geosid crystals you can buy them from a vendor who sells them along with other items.<br />There in my head since there is a crystal that can return life there should be a balance so of course there will be a Chaos Crystal which increases dmg like a white pot did on Xenimus, though this is a little rare and it does not work on players and cant be bought from vendors.<br /><br />and of course if you got to buy a crystal from a vendor there needs to be a different currency, Copper/Silver/Gold <br />100 copper = 1 silver<br />100 silver = 1 gold<br />100 gold = 100 gold <img src="images/smilies/icon_smile.gif" alt=":)" title="Smile" /> <br /><br />it is an easy system that can be learned by everyone.<br /><br />9.being the anime fan i am i would want to suggest that some rare weapons should be huge according to the wearers body and shiny.<br /> i just love the looks of huge shiny armors, the current armors look like jumpsuits or something or even pyjamas, they arent even bulky or plate looking <img src="images/smilies/icon_confused.gif" alt=":?" title="Confused" /> <br />Also maybe Shoulder items would be a cool idea?<br /><br /><br />Thats alot of ideas ive been thinking of a while enjoy the reading <img src="images/smilies/icon_biggrin.gif" alt=":D" title="Very Happy" /></div>

				<div class="content">One of the things I am REALLY against is being able to buy items to restore lots of hp.  (med wands)  That is just a no-no for any game that is going to have a decent future.</div>

				<div class="content">You play wow, you can exchange points for potions etc on battlegrounds, you can buy all kinds of stuff, but yeah im thinking they should be droppable only.<br /><br />Minor healing items should be able to be bought though you have to admitt that, for the lowbies.</div>

				<div class="content">Its not just from wow.  I've played a LOT of mmorpgs and the ones that put limitations on instant full or near full heals are usually the most balanced.  I've always hated games where you can just spam instant heals.</div>
