				<div class="content">Yes, I will be adding more regen for mage items.  It's possible that I will implement steals, but they are hard to balance so that might require a bit more design before I put them into the game.</div>

				<div class="content">I see, regen alone would help tons. I use 300 mp in like 6 or 7 spells. Regen at least will be a must to play affectively on a mage class. <img src="images/smilies/icon_cool.gif" alt="8)" title="Cool" /></div>

				<div class="content">It would be nice to see regens and buffs implemented better than they were in Xenimus.  Characters shouldn't be dependent on items such as meds/maxis. I like the idea of a spell for Wizards that would allow them to regen almost all their mana in matter of seconds. This and other spells / skills that reduce downtime and keep the pace of the game going.<br /><br />Also, I'm a huge fan of steals, including mp steal through spells.</div>

				<div class="content">Hmmm, actually i'm against steals. Or better i'm against steals like they are working in xenimus. Because there steals are simply overpowered. That's especially noticable on mage classes, where you don't have to use a single frigging potion for hunting (i levelled a druid, didn't need a single maxi for the levels 14-37). Add the usual better abilities of mage-classes (which they can execute freely during hunting because of steals) and you have part of the xenimus &quot;mage classes pwn fig classes&quot; problem.<br />So basically i wouldn't mind steals but i think they need ALOT of tweaking to not mess up the fairness/balance.</div>

				<div class="content">A game like xenimus of any sort need steals. They should be enough to make you live and to steal back mp. The hole point is to not slow down the pace to wait on mana. Being forced to use meds makes a hard choice, lower lvls either can't afford or higher lvl get them to cheap to matter. I remember lvling my mage before steals, it was pretty hard. Even with steals it can be hard.</div>
