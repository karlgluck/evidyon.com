				<div class="content">I know that game developement is impeded by the lack of free time by the developers, but I think it's been more than hinted at that the map release is in some way related to the amount of players on.<br /><br />-The map expansion came very quickly after the earth icon event (that was 20 or 30 people I don't remember)<br /><br />-<blockquote><div><cite>Evidyon Chronicles wrote:</cite>The first souls lost during the cataclysmic world-breaking Evidyon have begun their return. With their help, the Geosids reclaim power from items and have pushed back the Chaos surrounding Nexus. As it grew stronger, one Geosid has achieved new links with more distant pieces of the fractured world</div></blockquote><br /><br />Let's push for more players, let's break the 40 character mark this weekend!!!<br /><br />Edit- This theory has be disconfirmed.</div>

				<div class="content">I'm sure posting on the onrpg.com free mmorpg forums could attract some players. Isometric online RPGs(that are actually smooth and not laggy as hell) with fast paced PVP are VERY rare nowadays and I'm sure there's some people there that would check it out.</div>
