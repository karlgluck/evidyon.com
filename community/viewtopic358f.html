				<div class="date"><img src="./styles/prosilver/imageset/icon_post_target.gif" width="11" height="9" alt="Post" title="Post" />Posted: <strong>Tue May 26, 2009 4:29 pm</strong></div>
				<div class="author">by <strong>Karl G.</strong></div>
				<div class="content"><span style="font-size: 200%; line-height: 116%;"><a href="http://www.evidyon.com/download/install-evidyon.msi" class="postlink">http://www.evidyon.com/download/install-evidyon.msi</a></span><br /><br />If you're new, check out the <a href="http://www.unseenstudios.com/community/viewtopic.php?f=25&amp;t=1374&amp;p=8864#p8864" class="postlink">basic instructions</a>.<br /><br /><span style="font-weight: bold"><span style="font-size: 150%; line-height: 116%;">PK System</span></span><br />If you are the aggressor (i.e. you attack a person who hasn't done damage to you recently) the damage the player who is being attacked is reduced based on your difference in level.  This effect only lasts until the player who is attacked fights back.  If you are not the aggressor in a fight, you cannot lose alignment--so defending yourself is consequence-free.<br /><br />You cannot log off if you are engaged in combat.<br /><br />If you are level 3 or lower, <span style="font-weight: bold">you will never drop any items</span> when you die.<br />If you are level 5 or lower, <span style="font-weight: bold">you cannot be PKed unless you fight back</span>.<br />If you are level 7 or lower, <span style="font-weight: bold">you will not drop any equipped items</span> when you die.<br /><br />All players who hit another good player before they die are considered killers, regardless of who actually dealt the final blow.<br /><br />A PK is defined as being a killer of a player with a non-evil (i.e. neutral or better) alignment.  You cannot PK an evil player.  Killing evil players does <span style="font-weight: bold">not</span> count against you in any way.<br /><br /><br /><span style="font-weight: bold"><span style="font-size: 150%; line-height: 116%;">Alignment System</span></span><br />You are allowed <span style="font-weight: bold">one consequence-free pk each 24 hours</span>.  If you go 24 hours killing only one person, you will gain a point of alignment.<br /><br />Every person you kill within a 24 hour period of your last PK will decrease your alignment by an increasing amount.  Let me give an example:  You kill a player.  Ten minutes later you kill again and lose 1 point of alignment.  Four hours later you kill again and lose 2 points.  Ten hours later = 3 points.  You wait 24 hours after that last kill, and the counter resets.<br /><br />For every day you go only killing 1 person, you will gain 4 points of alignment.  Inactive characters (not played for more than a few days) gain at a slower rate.<br /><br /><br /><span style="font-weight: bold">Bonuses &amp; Penalties:</span><br />- Good characters drop fewer items, evil characters drop more items.<br />- The square will not protect an evil character.<br />- Evil characters spawn in the swamp.  For those of you that know the map, the columns have changed to make this place more accessible.<br /><br />For now, this is all.  In the future there will be bonuses and penalties beyond those listed here.<br /><br /><br />So here's the jist of this system:  Want to pk?  Great!  Do it in moderation.<br /><br /><span style="font-weight: bold">Update:  we now have a /ignore command.

				<div class="content">** My evil sorcerer has twice recalled to good-town on first recall after log-on.  I haven't been able to figure out what's causing this:  it happened once so I tried logging off and on a few times and running around and it happened again, but I haven't been able to make it happen a third time.  Both times it happened I was just off the square.</div>

We've designed the system to still allow a significant amount of PvP combat, and we're tweaking it right now to fix the small things and make it a little more permissive; we'll post an update of the rules when we're finished (which will be later today).  We're also planning to create a high-lvl free-for-all zone for later.  <img src="./images/smilies/icon_biggrin.gif" alt=":D" title="Very Happy" /><br /><br />Trans was removed from Knights.  This is mitigated by two things:  (1) there is now a &quot;Telemetrius Charm&quot; in game that should be &quot;fairly common&quot; (Karl's words); (2) there will be an Attack Run like Xen's at a later date.<br /><br />Hope that addresses your concerns.</div>
