				<div class="content">will vgv/vfv be in the game? cause they were taken out for a reason (making extreme lag on servers) I would really see em back, but maybe be changed on that they dont lag people out and crash servers?
<br />stupifacere will actually do something in this game? in xen it does almost nothing but costs tons of mana.
<br />rot flesh gonna be 33% again? if so, will it work in pvp in the same way? and what will warlocks have to finish mobs/people off?</div>

				<div class="content">To answer your questions, Delurium:
<br />
<br />VGV and VFV will return to PV, but for now I'm not sure what I'll do about them.  There seems no real reason they should cause so much lag.  EJ probably just spawned like 15 fireballs instead of making VFV/GV an actual spell.
<br />
<br />Stupefacere may just be removed.  If we can figure out something cool for it to do, I'll put that in, but in Xenimus it was always a stupid spell.
<br />
<br />When I first started playing Xenimus, I LOVED the balance between characters:
<br />
<br /><span style="font-weight: bold">Wizards vs Warlocks</span> - Wizards' attack could go straight through armor, dealing tons of direct damage.  However, the warlocks had an attack that would deal damage equal to 33% of the target's health, but it would be lessened by armor and magical protection.  Both classes got moonbeam, which they could use to finish off a target.  Wizards got fragor ipsum and adgredi at lower levels, but those spells weren't powerful enough to matter until higher levels.  In the same way, warlocks had poison spells (granted, they weren't nearly strong enough--they will be stronger in PV).*
<br />
<br /><span style="font-weight: bold">Cleric vs. Wiz/War</span> - Clerics' multi attack was REALLY strong, but it only hit a few targets (8) and only if they were evil.  Otherwise, clerics had to survive using moonbeam and, later, fragor adgredi.
<br />
<br /><span style="font-weight: bold">Theif vs. Fighter</span> - Theives could hit fast, and often from a range, but fighters could hit hard and take a lot of damage.  Also, theives had a larger multi attack than fighters.
<br />
<br /><span style="font-weight: bold">Paladin</span> - Paladins had to stay good so they couldn't PK a lot, but they could wear lots of armor and take almost as much damage as a fighter.  They also got divinus tueri for added protection and were thus better suited to fight off magic users, and could resurrect their comrades.
<br />
<br />
<br />So to answer your question, a lot of the spells will go back to the way they were.
<br />
<br />*<span style="font-weight: bold">Note:  Poison Spells</span>
<br />I'm considering having two flavors of poison spells--a 'red' and 'green' version.  Green will deal direct DOT, such as 10 dmg / second.  Red will deal % hp remaining DOT, such as 10% / second.  Red will take a long time to kill someone, but it weakens them a lot faster.  Green will kill them faster, but takes longer to weaken them.  A target can only be poisoned with one kind at a time.
<br />
<br />For Example:
<br />a character with 1000 HP:
<br />RED POISON, 10% dmg/sec:  1000 900 810 729 656 590 531 478...(takes 65 seconds to get to 1 HP)
<br />GREEN POISON, 50 dmg/sec:  1000 950 900 850 800 750 700 650...(takes 20 seconds to kill)</div>

				<div class="content">I like the poison idea Karl. I always felt EJ did one lame bum job at seperating the warlocks from wizards. I'd like to see more differences among classes (at least in warlocks) in PV than Xenimus had at the time were trying to recreate.</div>

				<div class="content">the mark system needs to be like it was before. 10 marks on home server 10 on ds. I hate only having 10 marks in total. and will it be cross server thing? hope not, I dont like x2 people lvling up to high lvls without getting pked and then goes x1 to pk.
<br />
<br />and ur answer on my last post was really good. I like the idea that warlocks get more poison oriented. but I dont like losing exp because I was poisoned before I died and it popping up again after I get up. that sucks nuts. all buffs, good or bad, should be totally removed when you die and not pop up again when u get up again.
<br />
<br />and about vfv/vgv you are prob right. ej prob didnt make it one spell but 15 balls popping up. that would hurt the server, but not as one spell</div>

<br />Don't worry, the poison will go away when you die (I promise I'll make sure that happens, poison after death totally sucks).</div>
