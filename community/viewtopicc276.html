				<div class="content">Put the Evidyon file out of program files and into your detskop, you are doing this cause evidyon doesnt have the authorities to alter files stored in c.\programfiles on vista.<br /><br />This works cause i did the same on my dads vista computer.</div>

				<div class="content">I did some research and Microsoft apparently has a way you can interface with Vista to override its security settings when you install a game.  It seems a bit complicated though (you have to do some crazy stuff in the install program) so it will probably have to wait.  For now, the best bet looks like installing it to My Documents or something stupid like that :/</div>
