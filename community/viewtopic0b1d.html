				<div class="content">Lets see if we can get a record number of players on this upcomming weekend.<br />We can set a date and time, (time being the time on this forum), and at that time I will see how many players are on. <br />Then we can have a give away of an item depending on the number of players online.<br />Kind of like when there were 12 players online and Karl gave out an Earthen Emblem to every player online.  He also said if there are over 20, then he would give out Holy Figurines.<br /><br />Depending of the progress of the upcomming map release, we may have the event on the new fully released map.<br /><br />So, does Saturday sound good.  I will get with Karl to check on the map progress.<br /><br />Please suggest times that are per the forum time.  I believe it is the same for everyone.</div>
