				<div class="content">Fear not:  it's are not as bad as you think!   <img src="./images/smilies/icon_smile.gif" alt=":)" title="Smile" /> <br /> Let me explain:<br /><br />(1)  The graphical bug (things floating around) is Vista-specific.<br />(2)  The BSOD bug is related to nVidia cards (unless you have a different brand of card, in which case we have a new problem).<br />(3)  Both of these bugs will be targeted in their own update very soon, once Karl finishes classes next week.  (There should be an update today, another update next week, and then the update to kill these bugs in the next couple weeks after that, depending on how things go).<br /><br />As for the sound bug, I have not experienced that (I run Vista).  I do, however, lose sound when I'm running the game full-screen and alt-tab out:  when I return to the game I don't have sound anymore.  Is that what you're experiencing, or is it something else?</div>

				<div class="content">Yeah, I talked to him.  It might be Vista-related, but I'm running Vista and have sound.<br /><br />Assuming that your speakers are on and your volume's not muted  <img src="./images/smilies/icon_razz.gif" alt=":P" title="Razz" />, check these things:<br />(a) in the Evidyon folder open the config.ini file and set the sound flag to 1.<br />(b) if your computer has a sound mixer make sure that the Evidyon volume is not muted.  I had mine muted accidentally for a couple weeks before I figured it out.<br /><br />Also, what I said above:  if you're running the game fullscreen and alt-tab, you lose sound.<br /><br />Hope one of these helps.  If not, we'll add it to the bug list.</div>

				<div class="content">Actually, the sound thing is my bad.  The computers where I did the big &quot;Evidyon shindig&quot; don't have sound cards, so I disabled sound in Evidyon by default and forgot to re-enable it.<br /><br />Go into Start &gt; Program Files &gt; Evidyon &gt; Edit Configuration and change the <span style="font-weight: bold">0</span> below to a <span style="font-weight: bold">1</span>:<br /><br /><blockquote class="uncited"><div>[Audio]<br />Enable=<span style="font-weight: bold">0</span></div></blockquote><br /><br />(this file is C:\Program Files\Evidyon\config.ini)</div>
