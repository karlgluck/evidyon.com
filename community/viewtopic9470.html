				<div class="content">Guys i am very amazed that a communal effort is going on to bring back this old school game which EJ really wrecked although i did have one question, will this include all different servers like the xenimus game now such as ANTI PK PVP and DS? or am i not going far back enough when there was probably only one server.
<br />
<br />I only ask because i would so much like for T7DS to come back! meeting new people from other servers there. what do you think?</div>

<br />When was DS ever an integral part of early xenimus? It wasnt. 
<br />There is no reason to have a DS in PV.</div>

				<div class="content">not at all. All of my memories of early xenimus have nothing to do with DS. as far as im concerned, the DS was one of the additions of xenimus that detracted from its early feel. Having enormous and complex dungeons is fine and all, but lets keep them within the primary map. 
<br />The structure of the DS is really useless anyway. In one room there will be daemon animus but in the next rogues and trolls? Fire imps right next to guardians? Thats ridiculous, and it makes the area useless for leveling until you are high enough to kill everything within a large swath of the place, sense creatures tend to wander into neighboring areas. 
<br />Truly, Xen's time of glory was pre-DS.</div>

<br />
<br />what he is saying is. At first of course there will be no DS. But the DS we have incorporated into the new feel xenimus (endless labyrinth of dungeons) is pretty sweet.
<br />
<br />He wants one to be made eventually... for the whole Idea of meeting new people/ leveling in secret spots/exploring.
<br />Althrough from understanding 1 gigantic server is what will be happening in PV. I totally agree with this concept. You could just make a dungeon that Is pretty much its own map but it resembles attributes of DS without the port lag of switching servers.</div>
