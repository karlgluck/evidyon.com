				<h3>Donation Idea</h3>

				<div class="content">Hello everyone,
<br /> Some of you may remember me from a while back as FLiP on XenTales. Anyways, I've been browsing around this forum recently and I think the concept behind PV is great. I can see that you guys are really short on cash, and I feel that I may have something that could help generate some cashflow that could be used towards developing this project.
<br />
<br />Anyways let me try and explain this idea as best I can:
<br />Recently I've been in the affiliate marketing industry. As a publisher, I develop various websites encouraging users to complete offers provided by specific advertisers. An example of an offer would be say Blockbuster Online. In exchange for these offer completions, both I and the user are compensated. 
<br />
<br />What I am suggesting is that I develop a website dedicated to raising funds for PV. I would include various offers that users interested in donating could complete. 
<br />
<br />Now you may ask yourself, why wouldn't I want to just donate via paypal directly?
<br />
<br />and to that I would answer:
<br />First of all, not all of the offers cost anywhere near what they payout. Additionally, often the offers provide decent services that you may be interested in. Let me give you guys a list of offers to demonstrate what I mean:
<br />
<br />Blockbuster Online - User pays $9.95 for at least 1 month of service (You can cancel after with no problems, though I would encourage otherwise) and $40 would be donated to the site for this signup
<br />
<br />Video Professor - User pays $6.95 for a computer lesson DVD and $40 is donated to the site for this signup (cancel anytime within 7 days/before trial ends to not be charged furthur)
<br />
<br />Gottaplay - User pays $1 for a two week trial to a video game rental service and $18 is donated to the site for this signup (cancel anytime to not be charged furthur, but I'd encourage giving the service a trial)
<br />
<br />True.com - User pays $1 for a 7 day trial to an online dating site and $32 is donated to the site. (cancel anytime within the 7 days to not be charged further)
<br />
<br />These are just a few of MANY offers I could include. If you're skeptical about using your credit card online there are several places where you can get virtual or prepaid ones. Most of the offers are set up by generally reputable companies though so it shouldn't be a big issue.
<br />Also the site that I'd establish to run these offers would be able to track offer completions so if you completed an offer both I and the owners at PV would be able to see who did it (so you can still get your donation benefits) 
<br />
<br />Anyways I was just thinking this might be a fast way to get to $400 or above. 
<br />
<br />Obviously you guys would have to trust me to establish this and send out the payments to Karl. and I'll be honest the reason I am willing to do this is because 
<br />1) I'd really like to see PV come out a success and I can see that the donations are going pretty slowly.
<br />2) I'll be taking anywhere from $1-$4 commissions on each offer. For example if True.com pays me $38 for each completion I would pay $34 to Karl.
<br />
<br />Also I have no problems giving someone of high status here access to my admin panel for that particular site so they can see the funds generated for themselves.
<br />
<br /> If you guys have any interest in this at all or have any questions feel free to contact me:

				<div class="content">just to throw in my opinion, if your a regular movie goer definitly try out blockbuster online, you'll love it and never go back <img src="./images/smilies/icon_razz.gif" alt=":P" title="Razz" />
<br />
<br />$40 to our site just for one month's membership to BB seems like a great way to build some capital.
<br />
<br />Not sure how many of our users would be interested in all this though, so what's everyone think?</div>
