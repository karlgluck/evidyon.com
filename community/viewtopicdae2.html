				<div class="content">Aside from making my post count go ever closer to 50!...<br /><br />lol, Anyway<br /><br />I have just been having a think whilst sitting in the office, nothing to do right now...So i've jumped onto the forums obviously, it's 09:16 here. Just out of interest directed to everyone really, what are your takes on a single or a couple of in gamemasters. I know with xenimus, it was a big annoyance when you got bugged or glitched and couldn't message a gamemaster or even EJ himself, mainly EJ (who didnt even know the game itself), but a gamemaster would probably have more of an idea being a dedicated player.<br /><br />My only reasons behind this is because, I know you have alot of time that will be focused in different places Karl, and I think that obviously you will be playing PV as much as you can, but for the time being especially for the introductory period with possibility of problems, you will be away to code and fix and update whilst people contacting to warn you of problems on forums or emails being very mismatched not collated. Do you think it would make your life easier with the functionality of in gamemasters being a benefit to PV which Xenimus was lacking by far. Listing bugs and problems using an in game GM dialog box which can be sent to the server, for you to look at (or something similar) Just been sitting here thinking away and didn't even realize the time lol,<br /><br /><br />Any Thoughts?<br /><br /><br />Take Care,</div>

				<div class="content">I've been thinking about this sort of thing and yes, it would be helpful, but actually implementing the system would take a significant amount of time--and for the first few months, the amount of time I'd have to devote to actually implementing that system would probably better be served by me playing the game and responding to issues personally.</div>
