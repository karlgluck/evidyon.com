				<div class="content">Making the agility stat affect cast speed sounds stupid and not logical.  What, does it make you stroke it faster so that you can high intensity discharge on someone?  Here is a solution that would be unique but work really well.  <br /><br />The only common Stat between mage and fig classes should be Constitution.  <br /><br />For Mage types, get rid of the stats Agility and Strength and replace them with something else (maybe one of the stats can affect cast speed) while the other does something else that is mage specific and be useful to a mage.  <br /><br />For Fighter types, get rid of Intelligence and Wisdom and replace them with something else that is fighter specific and useful to a fighter. (Maybe replace one of them with an endurance stat that affects the damage you do with your spell attacks such as spin and run attack).<br /><br />This would be a great change for the game.  Right now the system is very simple, Mage types have 3 important stats (Cons, Int, Wis) while Fighters have three important stats as well (Cons, Str, Agl).  No fighter type will invest points into Wisdom or Intelligence  because they do poo all for them compared to the other stats.  <br /><br />Putting in my idea will make the other two stats more useful for the respective character type.</div>

				<div class="content">I thought it made sense with Arcane Gestures and all.<br /><br />As for all that creating 4 new stats.  That is pointless, no other stat system has found it necessary to give mages different stats then the meelee's.  Just because they found a use for agility for mages doesn't mean they should rename it.<br /><br />Int is still useless for meelee and Str is still useless for mages, and if they find a use for them, they'll probably still be str and int</div>

				<div class="content">Changing stats may confuse a lot of people. It's sort of a retard prevention as well. What I mean is more points distributed throughout characters may confuse people, and it also protects people from screwing up the haracters. You have your main stats so you focus on that. It's a neat idea but not nescessary.</div>
