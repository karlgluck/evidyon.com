				<div class="content">So far ingame i have seen 1 hunter high lvl, this is why:<br /><br />1.They cant trans up to lvl 16(dunno when they can and if) <br />2. no special skill that makes them &quot;special&quot; besides being able to use bow in a different manner.<br />3.they use alot of mana spamming tornado.<br />4. their heals are manually clicked.<br />5. an average hp pool.<br />6. no spells which really increase their damage to an ammount that counts.<br />7. Haste buff can take as much as 30% of their health if they hit a area with alot of monsters, therefore it doesnt count as a buff since youd rarely use it.<br /><br />Also in pvp we need a single attack which does alot of dmg, used to be eagle eye but thats a normal dmg attack now.<br />Some spells which could be developed to actually make hunters interesting, suggestions though.<br /><br />Arrow Storm:<br />which would use massive ammounts of energy/mana to fire but would do alot of dmg, like a finnishing attack, well basically you would fire like 4-5 arrows at once which would go in a kinda Curve out from the hunter and into the target, spell could be named &quot;Arrow storm&quot;<br /><br />Hail of arrows:<br />And a Area effect spell for hitting multiple targets &quot;Hail of arrows&quot;<br /><br />Shadowstep:<br />And since hunter is supoused to be the speedy class i suggest that instead of run attack they have Shadowstep or something consuming just as much as a run attack but it is faster and you will only see something looking like a flash, and he could move fast past some minor objects trees, monsters etc like warriors leap.<br /><br />Noticed that a player would take advantage of my long range attacks and he attacked me if one of my arrows hit him, so we really need a -monsters -all button soon.<br /><br />any one else feel like hunters are gimps ingame.. tell the developers why.</div>

				<div class="content">Also found out Rapidshot doesnt work, and i dont dare try leap out on gaps because i think it doesnt work similar to the warriors leap.<br /><br />Also wonder why i cant shoot the test dmg skellie from long range, tornado works but not regular shooting.</div>

				<div class="content">I haven't played a hunter enough to be able to answer to many of these, but there are a couple I can help with:<br />* /monsters, /all are in the game.<br />* I do believe that you can shoot the skellie, though the one time I tried my char walked up to him before firing.<br />* I don't know about trans or leap, but that's what trans wands are for, right?</div>

It should also solve the problem of hunters not having enough MP and fighters not doing enough damage.</div></blockquote><br /><!-- l --><a class="postlink-local" href="http://www.unseenstudios.com/community/viewtopic.php?f=29&amp;t=2840&amp;view=unread#p13591">viewtopic.php?f=29&amp;t=2840&amp;view=unread#p13591</a><!-- l --><br /><br />That should help some, too.</div>
