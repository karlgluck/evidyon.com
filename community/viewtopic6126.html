Which division you are (lawful/neutral/chaotic) is based on your behavior; killing Lawful or Neutral players makes you more Chaotic, killing Evil or Rogue makes you more Lawful.<br /><br />NPCs also have alignment:<br /><br />Lawful NPCs attack Rogue, Evil and Chaotic Good characters.<br />Neutral NPCs attack Rogue and Evil characters<br />Chaotic NPCs attack Rogue, Evil and Lawful Good characters.<br />Rogue NPCs attack all other characters (including Rogues)<br />Evil NPCs attack Rogues and all Good characters</div>
