				<div class="content">Karl,<br /><br />Obviously item stat-balance isn't a main concern atm, but I've been looking over a lot of them and have made note of quite a few things.  In regards to drop rate vs. value of the items there is quite an imbalance, and as it has already been pointed out, there are several missing stats.  If you would like, I could compile a list here for future review that would include these items and possible suggestions.</div>
