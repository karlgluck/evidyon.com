				<div class="content">Some comments i found about Evidyon on Xentales, just to get a outsider look on the game.<br /><br />i just edited this in here because it kinda deserves a spot in here <img src="images/smilies/icon_biggrin.gif" alt=":D" title="Very Happy" /><br /><br />Veilside &quot;There should be a warning on the homepage, something along the lines of.&quot;<br /><br /><span style="font-weight: bold">&quot;WARNING: Evidyon may cause serious and permanent eye damage if play time exceeds 45 seconds, without the use of sunglasses.&quot;</span><br />they are aiming for the superbright colors here lol.<br /><br />1.You have to give it to them...wasn't it like 3 kids who were still in college who created it? I mean if they spent 24/7 and it looked like it did, then maybe there would be room to complain, but the simple fact that they made a game and still went to school, plus probably had a job is kind of impressive to me.<br />I would play, <span style="font-weight: bold">but I've got a mac so I don't think I can.</span><br /><br />2.I used to be really interested in it, but it kinda killed any expectations I had once it finally started coming together. It just looks terrible and I could never get in touch with the controls. I'm sure they've changed a bit, but I don't have the will to try it again.<br /><br />3.I said colours, not graphics.<br /><br /><span style="font-weight: bold">As in the colours are not so unnatural that it give me a headache to look at the screen.</span><br /><br />As in the scheme isn't proposterously full of purples and strange blues, like WoW.<br /><br />(edited here to rescind a comment.)<br /><br />I'm not saying this is a game that no one should miss out on, <span style="font-weight: bold">I'm saying that this is a game that I like, and I'd like it even more if the player base was bigger. </span>There are people out there who might like it too that don't even know it exists. (edited here to rescind a comment.)<br /><br />4.I've played for a bit and got to level 25.<br /><br /><span style="font-weight: bold">Bad gameplay, bad graphics (worse than Xen arrr) and unbalanced.</span><br /><br />The game doesn't feel right. I like the Xen feel where you create a new chr and you start in some kind of a town. In <span style="font-weight: bold">Evidyon its just a square with 2 merchants </span>on it. Yo go outside of this &quot;town&quot; and you <span style="font-weight: bold">start getting attacked by these crazy bum monsters that look like they should kill you in 1 shot but they are weak (this compared to Xen's bugs, imps, and rouges outside of towns which has a much better feel). </span>The controls of your character are sloppy especially when you cast some spells such as wirlwind or whatever. <br /><br />The leveling system is stupid. If you are alone and have no really good friends in game good luck leveling cause your experience will be crap. If you are really popular or have many friends in game, you just hunt together in a party and you get like 100x the experience and you can level in no time.<br /><br />The items in the game look gay. Yellow and blue pajamas for armor, while you wear a towel on your head for a helmet arrr.<br /><br />The only good news is, its in Beta so they can improve arrr. I'd rather pay 5$ to play Xen than to play Evidyon for free. <br /><br />My final verdict. Evidyon is a crappier version of Xenimus for the poor.<br /><br /><br />Marzuku:<br /><br />1.well atm i think people are kinda bummed out about that you have no low level monsters that actually look low lvl and weak, because they all look crazy atm like something you would hunt later on on higher lvls.<br />suggestion: create some tiny monsters in form of a worm or something and little spiders that people can hunt when they are low level, atm the scaling of monsters and the variety is kinda fucked up, you should ask players how it should increase by levels, size is always a good scaling.<br /><br />2.People are reacting to the superbright armors, and armors generally.<br />suggestion: like i said before, make them less bright and instead of going with 1 color, go with 2 or even 3, im aiming at all armors after iron plate because thats the only pro looking texture and armor, with mixed colors and shoulderpads and different colored pants etc.<br />Helmets should have different forms, maybe have horns or maybe cover the entire face etc.<br /><img src="../../api.ning.com/files/s5mGEJQZWX1xnUkwbtxsK-aOByNqCol-Kw-0QvBsng95f53YzugPcHgc_PN3D-qJhGMi0Q4k16sVznWkf4hUQPf576XqZkY7/03Gladiator_helmet_full.html" alt="Image" /><br /><img src="../../www.a2armory.com/images/helmets/gladiator.jpg" alt="Image" /><br /><img src="../../www.aspencountry.com/assets/product_images/product_lib/38000-38999/38194.jpg" alt="Image" /><br /><br /><br />3.people are reacting to the mediocre town on the plateu.<br />Suggestion: some housing, Square can look Celestial instead of like normal tiles, maybe guards can patrol?<br /><br />ALSO might add, the common person when asked what he thinks a plate armor is, he will say something bulky and deffensive looking, being yellow doesnt make you deffensive, so maybe highlight the parts that look &quot;Armory-like&quot; same goes for lightning leather.<br /><br />A plate is still a plate, should have metal, and if its holy maybe a little holy yellow on the shoulderpads or whatever.<br />Leather is still leather, should be brown leather with maybe some blue like.. for the &quot;lightning&quot; effect.</div>

And as it is in beta, any measures Xenimus may have in place to catch it don't exist.... yet... However: it is possible in xenimus to have to different accounts, you just have to pay. Still cheating? =/</div>

The community has turned into a trash can full of assholes who continue to put up with EJ's destructive decisions because their characters have such good gear and are in their 50s to even think about quitting and selling their characters(and gear) for a whole lot of money for something that will do them better in the long run.  Many fail to realize that this game is still in early beta, it had just got out of alpha and the developers are having difficulties delivering content/fixing things on a consistent basis due to their time-constraints.<br /><br />Sure this may be this and that is that, but there is still room and time to improve.  You just need to be patient and keep offering suggestions like you are in the second half of your post.  Make it a detailed easy-to-read list so that the developers can acknowledge them better.</div>
