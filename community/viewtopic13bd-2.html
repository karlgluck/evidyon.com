				<div class="content">I have reasons for this,<br /><br />everything was solved earlier on Karl,<br /><br />but it seems that I am back to where we were originally <img src="./images/smilies/icon_sad.gif" alt=":(" title="Sad" /><br /><br /><br />What I can say is this is what I see may have happened. When I left my computer connected in game I then came back to it on the &quot;Stop Trying to Connect Screen&quot;<br /><br />I clicked the button, and the game exited, aftr I tried to restart the game and log back in...I get BSOD's on the nv4_disp.dll again.<br /><br /><br />Maybe the &quot;Stop Trying to Connect&quot; screen is causing infinite loops??, this would explain the unusual heat differences, and fan differences on some of the graphics cards??<br /><br /><br />I hope to get back on tonight!!! its, 19:45 here <img src="./images/smilies/icon_razz.gif" alt=":P" title="Razz" /> would be awesome if it is a possible fix!<br /><br /><br />All the Best,<br />Richard</div>

				<div class="content">for now I can get back on.<br /><br />I decided to create a &quot;new&quot; character and enter the world. This actually worked for me allowed me on without BSOD. so I log out of that one, and jump onto the main character and that worked, without a BSOD...<br /><br /><br />Very Strange! - will keep you posted though <img src="./images/smilies/icon_smile.gif" alt=":)" title="Smile" /> In this thread thadius <img src="./images/smilies/icon_razz.gif" alt=":P" title="Razz" /></div>

				<div class="content">Ok I can confirm.<br /><br />When starting the game from fresh. Whether it be after a server restart or after exiting the client completely, then entering the world with my main character will resolve in a BSOD nv4_disp.dll<br /><br />However, if i load a different character which I have created seperate to this one, then I do not get a BSOD. If I then press escape when logged in on my secondary character and DO NOT logout, it gives me the option to click my main character, I click my main character and this will enter the world without a BSOD <img src="./images/smilies/icon_smile.gif" alt=":)" title="Smile" /><br /><br /><br />I hope this thread helps Karl,<br /><br />I think I'm onto something here. <img src="./images/smilies/icon_smile.gif" alt=":)" title="Smile" /><br /><br /><br />Richard</div>

				<div class="content">I think I may be crashing the server somehow, with my main character being stuck in some sort of loop.<br /><br />Everytime I kill a monster, They <span style="font-weight: bold">ALWAYS</span> drop a real large stack of the <span style="font-weight: bold">SAME</span> items...very odd...<br /><br />I can go so long on the server kill a certain amount, or stay connected for a certain amount of time and then...I freeze, &quot;Stop Trying to connect&quot; appears, and then I log back in on my secondary (avoiding the nv4_disp.dll BOSD) hit escape, log onto the main character and voilla i am back on the game again without bsod, hmmmm.<br /><br />I don't know for sure that it is me being stuck in loop causing this crash, but that is twice now after about the same amount of time... will try again<br /><br /><br />Richard</div>

				<div class="content">I don't know if you have fixed the HP issue on respawn Karl, but when I am on my main character using the technique above, then when I die i always respawn with full HP including the added HP from items...<br /><br />Very perculiar!<br /><br />unless this has been fixed <img src="./images/smilies/icon_smile.gif" alt=":)" title="Smile" /></div>

				<div class="content">After all of this....<br /><br />I have fixed it,<br /><br />I think what is causing it is the inventory bug, you know the one that was posted with the wierd symbols being shown as items.<br /><br /><a href="http://www.unseenstudios.com/community/viewtopic.php?f=22&amp;t=952" class="postlink">http://www.unseenstudios.com/community/viewtopic.php?f=22&amp;t=952</a><br /><br /><br />When I hovered over certain items it would usually change them to the above screenshot, this was when everything was working. Occasional items in the inventory would cause the above to happen.<br /><br />owever, I had one particular of these items that was at the top of my inventory, so my inventory was showing constantly as all those funky symbols. After dropping this item and opening the inventory again ,everything was showing OK.<br /><br />I then exit the client completely, re log back in (Without using my secondary character) and No BSOD occured. I actually did this a couple of times and it seemed to be working fine, if I get this error again with the top item in my inventory i will try this and get a bsod if possible, then I can definately say for sure.<br /><br />But for now after dropping that item causing the above screenshot, There are no BOD at all yet.<br /><br />Richard</div>

				<div class="content">Ok now I was just wondering around on my main character, and then another nv4_disp.dll BSOD occured, I am going to try the secondary character method... if that does not work I will try creating a new character and entering the world on a new character and then jumping onto the main character without logging out <img src="./images/smilies/icon_smile.gif" alt=":)" title="Smile" /></div>

				<div class="content">top to this thread, but also... it seems that one of my secondary characters is now BSOD'ing on entering the world...very odd,<br /><br />All that I had done was level about 3 or 4 levels constantly, rarely logging out, then suddenly I log out and then try to log back into it after closing the client. and BSOD on that character also <img src="./images/smilies/icon_smile.gif" alt=":)" title="Smile" /></div>

				<div class="content">Right now what I did to fix the issue on both of these characters, was to log onto them using my brothers computer, move my them both around. Log out on my borthers and log back in on mine, this seems to have solved the issue for now <img src="./images/smilies/icon_smile.gif" alt=":)" title="Smile" /></div>
