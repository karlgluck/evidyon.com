				<div class="content">Ok I am willing to give whatever aid I can in this endeavor.
<br />Quite a few people know me for ripping into EJ and trying to get his bum to do things.
<br />I have always been for game balance and would love to help in that aspect mainly.
<br />
<br />
<br />Is the game going to be more old school, or old school with better tweaks?
<br />
<br />I would love old school with better tweaks.
<br />
<br />For one I would love to see more weapons, that have varied requirements.
<br />These would ensure no carbon copy builds.
<br />
<br />For one, say a pair of nun-chuks (just and example) these would have great damage, but would need strength, agility and intelligence to properly weild.  
<br />On the other hand a Claymore would need mainly strength and cons.
<br />
<br />This way people could make new characters based on a weapon they find = fewer perfect build characters.
<br />
<br />Wisdom would not be good for weapon reqs, but would be a huge factor in skill points and magical spells.
<br />
<br />
<br />In my opinion any class should be able to have any build they want, the stats should be there to maintain evenness.
<br />
<br />I see no reason why Fighters can be either Balanced, Strength like Conan, Speed Like Zorro, Agility like a cat, or Intelligence to deal out deadly blows.
<br />
<br />But that is my take, looking forward to hearing from you guys.</div>

				<div class="content">We are actually considering having no requirements for weapons/armor except for certain, super rare legendary weapons like the Sword of Skull, Sun Staff, etc.
<br />(btw DanJR its me ZAP from way back) 
<br />If a dummy wants to put a bunch of spirit gear on his level 5 let him, we can laugh when he gets pked for it.
<br />
<br />as far as builds go, I also think its a good idea to make all stats useful for all classes. A fighter shouldnt be punished for putting a few points on intel or wisdom. Then again, most people will just stack them on strength and cons anyway.</div>

				<div class="content">I agree with you for the most part, and yes it will be like old school xenimus with tweaks to make it better (Basically everything everyone wanted but EJ never did).
<br />
<br />As far as builds go, you are right there shouldn't be cookie cutter builds. EJ USED to have it semi-right when i had thadius because I had 18 int, BUT it didn't screw me up because I actually hurt due to the extra points on weapon mastery.</div>

				<div class="content">This game will definitely be old-school with tweaks.  Tweaks involve a ton of new content and redesigned character-building system.  This will all have to be designed at some point, but I'm still in the technical-world at this point and won't be thinking about that for a while.</div>
