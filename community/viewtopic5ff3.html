				<div class="content">Hey guys, i know this may sound silly but are the majority of this community from the USA or Canada? are there many other players from Europe? or even in fact britain?? J
<br />
<br />ust wondered it may be useful for you to have a european admin or moderator for the boards or in game in case of cheaters or people being exsessivly rebelious. I have been online on the boards now for about 2 hours, and i am the only person online, I know there are not many people in the community yet well there are quite a few already but there are no moderators on at this time of the day.
<br />
<br />Might this cause any problems when the game is released? or even on the forums?</div>

				<div class="content">Xenimus has always been surprisingly diverse for a game with servers only in the US. 
<br />Lots of british, Norwegians, Australians, etc. Id wager we dont see many asians due to the horrible ping time. My friend Chris goes to japan every summer and he says xenimus is unplayable form there. 
<br />I myself am from the states, as you know.</div>
