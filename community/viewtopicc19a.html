				<div class="content">&quot;good&quot; is very subjective; the best texture artists can make 250 poly models look incredible, and bad modelers can use 150000 polys, smoothing, normal, bump and texture maps with per-pixel lighting and still end up with a heaping pile of poo.  But a &quot;good&quot; quality character model for this game should likely be around 2000-3000 polys.</div>

				<div class="content">ok that gives me some leeway with the models that I'm making
<br />I was thinking more of the 500-800 or so that xenimus models have.
<br />
<br />But yeah you're right about good being subjective
<br />
<br />Maybe I should have phrased it as what would be a good range of poly for a character.
<br />2000-3000 will be good though, so I'll get started once again.</div>

<br />And we could always make up a back-story for the lizard class if we need to, like the Argonians in the Elder Scrolls series.</div>

				<div class="content"><span style="font-weight: bold">Dregs:</span>
<br />Dregs are humans with <span style="font-weight: bold">ogre</span> blood in them, not orcs or giants.
<br />
<br />The best model for a dreg would be the oldschool ogre model (one simmillar of course)
<br />
<br />As for their name, if you can't use Dreg, how about 
<br />
<br />&quot;Half-Ogre&quot; or &quot;Ogre-crossed Human&quot; I like Ogre-crossed Human. It leaves open possibilites for other races. &quot;Orc-crossed human&quot; &quot;Wolf-crossed human&quot;
<br />
<br /><span style="font-weight: bold">Behoks:</span>
<br />Behoks are a servant race created by Oreseth. They can have any model possible, as it seems, Ej just got lazy and didn't give them their own model. They could be rat-men for all we know, but that race is very alterable.
<br />
<br />
<br />Well, I think you guys probably covered the other races, but that's my thoughts on those two. It's important to remember that Dregs are half ogres, not half giants.</div>

				<div class="content">i know i made the sugguestion before.
<br />xantusian for Scally
<br />Nomad for Dreg.
<br />
<br />Karl liked them, only one person spoke up about xantusian because he didnt like how it was said... 
<br />so yeah we do still need a name for Behock.
<br />
<br />its not that important that Dregs (Nomads) are half-oger as they are in Xenimus. we are using Xenimus as a template for better game. we are not copying xen, only trying to copy the feeling of old xen.</div>

				<div class="content">Ogre blood in dregs is a major part of the feel of Xen.
<br />
<br />
<br />I refuse to be a fighter without at least 5% ogre blood in me. It's unheard of.
