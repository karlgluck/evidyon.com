				<div class="content">I've been playing xen for years but many people don't know of me. Anyways I decided to come back to xen recently and noticed on xentales that this game was in beta. To me, it looks pretty promising. A big issue with xen was that EJ does not care for our concerns, and it seems Karl and his team truly appreciate what you guys have to say. <br /><br />Now to the reason I'm posting. I want to know from the players what are the reasons why you play, what're somethings you don't like, is it truly like old school xen, and would it be worth time to invest in. I'm highly interested and I'd try it myself but I'm at work ATM so your responses will be greatly appreciated. Thanks ahead of time.</div>

				<div class="content">It's got a lot of the feel of old xenimus with a lot of the additions you wish EJ would have done. Considering how long they have been working on it and are already this far should be all the promise you should need. You missed some of the older beta and alpha so you cant see some of the things Karl and his team already have up there sleeve. Once beta is ready to go this game will be absolutely amazing, and in my opinion better than xen. The people are friendly and will be glad to help you out. You should deffinitely give it a try and hit me up if you see me in game and I'll help you out.</div>

				<div class="content">So far I really like it. I mean obviously there's a few graphic things that bother me but compared to xen graphics overall, they're realy nice. The combat is very smooth but I did notice when using whirlwind attack he didn't actually spin. But minor things like that doesnt make a game for me. I do think that party xp is a little hax but if I remember correctly that's going to be fixed. The game is lacking somethings such as houses and more merchents that normally make a town feel thriving and busy but unlike some others, I understand it's beta. (which is different from xen beta cause that games been in &quot;beta&quot; for almost 10 years&gt;.&gt;)I haven't played enough yet but so far it's looking great. Overall, I'm level 17 and really looking forward to updates. I can't believe three college kids put this together in their spare time. I already got another xenimus fan coming over to try Evidyon.  <br /><br />Also, some commands are dumb like /standup but I'm hoping those will be revised and changed. <br /><br />See you guys on today!<br /><br />Edit: lol thanks fearon for saying you'd help me and then pk me the first time you see me in game lol &lt;3</div>
