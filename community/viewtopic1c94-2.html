				<div class="content">Read that karl is trying to make complicated enchantments which increase by level, <br /><br />reasons why not to go all out of your way for it:<br /><br />Grinding game, people will most likely change wepons every week until they find something insane and even then they will be high lvl.<br /><br />increasing powers on level was a problem on the Alpha, people got powerfull by level and actually used it to advantage to create a insanely tanky players whom f.ex could sprint 300mph or players whom added all str or all hp etc, am i wrong or does this kinda ruin the &quot;Building the perfect character&quot; aspect of xen/evidyon? people would find good builds and keep them secret etc, it was part of the game.<br /><br />to be honest i feel like these enchantments are like cheating, because they are adding powers by the level, to some one whom might be utterly incompetent.<br /><br />you could make some items though whom added special enchantments, chance to increase attack speed by 20% for 5 seconds, Blast the target with 40 fire/frost damage</div>

				<div class="content">If he does go through with this system of having the enchantments increasing will levels (highly likely). Have the increments be every 5, 10, or 15 levels and have the amount of increase of the stats be +1, +2, or even percentage base like 1.25% something small. But items could have enchantments like you have stated and they would be procs and could simply make the enchantment system a lot easier.<br /><br />I do agree that having a system where lets say the enchantments increase every time you do level in the end will just tip the balance scale, until someone else obtains that same weapon or armor and gets the same level or higher. <br /><br />This would ultimately suck.</div>

What it sounds like you're worried about is the level system itself (power increases with level).<br /><br />Think about it this way:  how is improving enchantments with level substantially different than just giving a character more powerful enchantments every so many levels?</div>

				<div class="content">Woah now.  I was ignoring your other post for these reasons, and I'm locking this one for the same.<br /><br />- you haven't played this version<br />- you have no idea how it is going to be implemented<br />- the way you suggested to &quot;change&quot; it was actually a bad way of implementing what I already have in mind<br /><br />Enchantments are not just a percentage; the spell you get at level 1 to add 10% hp (<span style="font-weight: bold">if one existed</span>) won't give you 10% hp at level 150.  It adds 10% until level 8 or so.  Let's say that is 50 HP.  After that, casting that spell will never give you more than 50 hp.  To get more hp you have to use the next version, which costs more mp, looks different and gives you 10% increase in hp for levels 10-30.<br /><br />As I said, for now no enchantment has much of an effect at all.</div>
