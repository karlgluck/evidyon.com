				<div class="content">Okay everyone, Joe and I had a long talk today about how best to get the community more involved in this project.  For the reasons stated before, we can't make this game open source--but we can come pretty darn close by making it essentially a &quot;skeleton&quot; game in which all the content is created by data files. The best part is, I already have a working language that can do this!  Unfortunately, I have to do some serious clean-up on the code for the client and map editor to include this new feature--but once it's in, you guys won't have to wait for me to add your models to the game or load up new maps in the client.</div>

<br />This move should make development much easier in our web-based setting:  by giving every member the ability to design, test, and implement features that occur to them, y'all can participate more directly in the development process without necessarily learning the intricacies of the code.  Each member will be able to use the game itself as a sandbox to test new ideas, and then send their ideas straight to Karl for approval and placement in the game.</div>

				<div class="content">Sounds like a good idea but im a bit skeptical, and here's why. Ultimately, sure, this will speed up the addition of content in the game but it sounds like it could push &quot;core&quot; development back further. Most people here just want a clone of old xenimus, nothing much more, but nothing less. Thad pumped out a crapload of models, why can't we just use those and and whatever's left can be added in the future. Their shouldn't be any issues as really it would be a project &quot;under development&quot; and not cost anyhting to the users. Just add in some networking features where we can host our own server or let's have a small server that can be used for testing purposes. Just my 2 centz yo  <img src="./images/smilies/icon_cool.gif" alt="8)" title="Cool" /></div>

<br />That's exactly the problem I'm solving with this.  I can't put in new models because they're not in the MDJ format, and the way I had things set up it was very very restrictive.  Right now I've replaced the whole texture system with a nice script, and it works perfectly.  I'm moving on to mesh types now so that when I'm done, thad can just plug in his new models without having to wait for me to see if they work at all.</div>
