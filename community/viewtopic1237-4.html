You wont be able to get the automatic update, most likely because the server is still down, though I obviously can't check.</div>

				<div class="content">No the update downloads fine from the launcher, you can download the files manually from <!-- m --><a class="postlink" href="http://www.unseenstudios.com/evidyon/download/update/*filenames*.exe">http://www.unseenstudios.com/evidyon/do ... names*.exe</a><!-- m -->, so it's not the files its simply the launcher..<br /><br />The server isn't up because of the hurricane thats why you can't log on..</div>

				<div class="content">Yeah it's definitely not supposed to update constantly like that.  The 'version' file isn't being updated because the directory is read-only for some reason and it the launcher can't edit the file.<br /><br />To fix for now, download this file and put it in c:\program files\evidyon:<br /><br /><a href="http://www.unseenstudios.com/evidyon/download/update/version" class="postlink">http://www.unseenstudios.com/evidyon/download/update/version</a></div>

Updated, clicked &quot;play,&quot; couldn't connect to server:  all the same as before.  Quit, started again--exact same thing.</div>

				<div class="content">Never mind that:<br /><br />I turned off &quot;read-only,&quot; but when I checked again it had turned itself back on (part-way, not for all files)!  Vista won't let me take &quot;read-only&quot; off of a Program Files directory, it seems.  (even w/ UAC off)<br /><br /><span style="font-style: italic">edit:  more information:<br />none of the files themselves are read-only, so I don't know what is.  Also, running the launcher &quot;as administrator&quot; doesn't help.  And the security settings won't let me give full control to &quot;CREATOR OWNER,&quot; which I assume is you, Karl.<br /><br />Yet more information:<br /><br />The evidyon_sse files are being created just fine.  The updates aren't changing the &quot;config&quot;, &quot;version&quot;, or &quot;evidyon.gme&quot; files.<br /><br /><span style="font-weight: bold">Got it!  If you un-hide the &quot;version&quot; file, the launcher can edit it!</span>  Of course, you can just manually edit the version number if you feel like doing it that way.</span></div>
