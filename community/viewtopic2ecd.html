				<div class="content">Well i tried lvling with the General agility stat and i found it rather troublesome, this is why:<br /><br />If we are going to have assasins/rogues/rangers we need a special stat which they can call their own which always has been &quot;Agility&quot;<br />Ranger on Xen was a big letdown cause they were hard to lvl and they were not easy to fight with, which is why we should have a good class like that.<br /><br />With a ranger/rogue/assasin we could introduce dualwield with swords or the usage of a bow.<br /><br />On every game you probably have played, every class has their own priority stat which they should increase, Xen had that.<br /><br />Xen, didnt let players increase their speed by each level instead Ej made it so that with 30 agility fighters/paladins could get fast spin which was a boost of spin.<br />Casters got fast beam, and dunno fast lightning.(though we could do it so that to get fast beam you need a amount of 30 wisdom( f. ex Wisdom of magic usage)<br /><br />Xen was created this way to make a path for players who had skills, which was how it ended people on lvl 25 battling lvl 40's and winning etc.<br /><br />Agility should only be attack power for a ranger/rogue/assasin class.</div>

				<div class="content">A image that features the properties a Xen weapon would have if it was 7 proped which is what i think we should be using aswell instead of these random props with 600% mp steal etc, this way weapons could be blank or up to 3 prop and you would have to prop it yourself at a shrine.<br />Weapon properties<br /><img src="../../img99.imageshack.us/img99/894/bmacebe7.html" alt="Image" /><br />Helmet properties<br /><!-- m --><a class="postlink" href="../../xenimus.com/shots/shot13.html">http://xenimus.com/shots/shot13.jpg</a><!-- m --><br /><br />and i think armors had<br />2 mp reg<br />2 hp reg<br />7% reflective<br />10 protection</div>

				<div class="content">So you suggest:  (a) &quot;Agility should only be attack power for a ranger/rogue/assasin class&quot; ; (b) &quot;i think we should be using [a prop system like Xen's] instead of these random props.&quot;<br /><br />But <span style="font-style: italic">why</span> should either be the case?  I don't see any reasons given for why things should be this way, other than &quot;Xen did it this way.&quot;  That's fine, but what about the way of doing things itself should make us do it that way?</div>

				<div class="content">So if I'm understanding you correctly:<br />(1)  You're concerned that there's not enough room in the current system, with AGI affecting speed (general, attack, cast), for a &quot;speed&quot; class like a Rogue.<br />(2)  You want a prop shrine.<br />(3)  You want Lvl and Attribute (and Class?) requirements on items.<br /><br />Well, (2) and (3) will happen eventually.  I'm not certain what form the item requirements will take, but we can't have lvl 1's running around with, say, Spirit Swords. <img src="images/smilies/icon_razz.gif" alt=":P" title="Razz" />  As for (2), we will of course have some way to enchant items, but whether that will take the form of a shrine or some enchantment skill or perhaps both, I'm not certain.<br /><br />As for (1), it is of course a concern that we be able to create distinct classes, but I'm not certain how the current system inherently precludes a &quot;speed&quot; class:  such a class could easily have abilities that rely on AGI that other classes don't have, the same way that WIS affects everybody's MP, but only a defensive magic-user really needs it for its other function.  Does that make sense?  We may, of course, have to make AGI have <span style="font-style: italic">less</span> of a difference as regards speed.</div>

				<div class="content">Geonite will be used for propping items.  It isn't implemented at the moment, but items already have special properties--what you see on the items right now are just innate properties I assigned to make items more unique.<br /><br />Attribute, level and skill requirements on classes will happen.  However, I'm strongly averse to a class requirement.  If you're high enough level and have the stats/skill points necessary to use an item, you should be able to use the item.<br /><br />As far as agility goes, although all classes benefit from increased agility the Hunter will be different.  Joe pointed out that defensive mages need wisdom, even though all classes have MP affected by wisdom.  Similarly for the Hunter, many of its abilities will be based on agility (particularly the chance of critical strike).  I can't say much more because I haven't finished designing it.</div>

				<div class="content">ok let me settle this debate<br />first of all aligity wasnt the rangers thing <br />hide skill was.<br />and second of all  i dont think that you need a <br />prop shrine.<br />but if you wanted to add props to items <br />maybe there could be gems added to the game<br />for this purpose.like ifyou had a blood<br />diamond it would give you +20 protection<br />or maybe a black onyx that would <br />let you  do like 10% more damage <br />or some thing.<br />i mean when you can go and prop gear then the <br />value or a rare item is depleated. i mean if you <br />can find any item and just prop it. as apposed to<br />just finding an item that maybe someone else has fouhd<br />but yours has special props.</div>
