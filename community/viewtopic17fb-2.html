				<div class="content">Ok I want to start off by saying thanks to Karl and his crew. I've been hearing of project volucris for about a year probably, and seen or heard no faces or names... then I was introduced to this site, and with skepticism I proceeded to join and become a part. Now I see there's actual dedication and it's coming along very quickly. I found myself actually exited when reading your updates list. Great job, great listener! hooray for karl. This game could be a great investment of time. and I'm starting to feel glad to be partaking. that's a good thing. YOURE ALMOST THERE....months away from the best game ever.<br /><br />-prehistohizzle</div>
