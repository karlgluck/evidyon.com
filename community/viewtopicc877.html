				<div class="content">I was having a ponder on guilds earlier today and had come to the conclusion that as it stands guilds are great but there really is no  incentive to make guilds exclusive. It would be pretty cool if with every new guild member the bonus you got from every geoside would be reduced BUT all members can work the guild (as a whole) bonus's up by sacrificing. The leaders/founder of guilds can see who is pulling  their weight. Along with the dragon growing with sacrifices this would really add another dynamic to the game rather then the traditional hunt/gather. Or possibly to create an incentive for the reining guilds to put potions/valts ect on the bazaar and a % of the selling price is put into a guild treasury which could be used to buy additional guild upgrades which would increase geosid protection/guild bonus's ect. Just some ideas and I understand this is an aspect Karl and such probably are not thinking about right now but worth throwing out there.<br />Peace<br />Willy</div>

				<div class="content">Willy, the aspect of doing something more with geonite has been discussed with Karl.  I suggested that there be a menu made available by right-clicking on the geosid crystals.  <br />This menu would consist of areas that the geosid could be expanded.  There would be an account balance of sacrificed geonite for each category listed below.  So that as long as the balance of an account is larger than the expenditures, then items will be upkept, i.e. spawning geosid guards at a geonite price for each. <br />These areas are:<br />-Geosid guards, with possibility of spawning multiple and different creatures at a certain cost of geonite<br />-Defenses, like magic barriers so that guilds have to be mixed with different classes.  So that a groups of srocs or adepts cant deal damage over a distance while the warrior is unable to attack and defend his geosid.<br />-Walls, different sized walls to limit line of sight and increase the mystery of there being anyone in the geosid to guard it.</div>

In addition I would think that there would be more geosids in harder to reach areas that have greater rewards, but that is a theory that we will see when the map expands.</div>

				<div class="content">There will be more geosids.  The map size right now is nothing compared to the real map Karl has planned.<br />There are better rewarding geosids that will be implemented.  Karl was thinking of an epic weapon spawning geosid.<br />This kind of geosid would require a high amount of geonite to conjure the epic weapon spawn.  This geonite number has <br />not been decided yet.<br /><br />I do not know the number of geosids that Karl has on the designed map for the full release.  I have not zoomed in far enough to<br />see the geosid map placements, the map is huge.</div>
