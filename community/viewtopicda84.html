				<div class="content">Well ill keep this simple, by filling your inventory you lead the server(i believe) to think you have grinded alot and it responds by dropping something a little more valuable, i have not noticed this before some days ago and it was a theory until snuggles backed me up and also thought it worked.<br /><br />on this way of looking for items i have found most of my inventory storage etc, its a grind type for the patient type though, and it might just be a theory.<br />Got the idea from Joe.M when i asked him how he grinded and he was on fire with loot and all stuff.</div>

				<div class="content">Hmm.  That would be weird, but now that I think about it I do seem to find better loot after I've been grinding for a while.<br /><br />Karl?</div>

				<div class="content">Also found it wierd how the drops sometimes work.  Like, I'll be grinding for a while and have mostly junk and then BAM!  1 monster drops multiple good items.  Off one kill the other day I had a spirit sword, aurelian plate, and a silver ring drop.  Then 2 days ago I had another wand of starlight drop with a gold or crystalline ring.</div>
