				<div class="content"><blockquote><div><cite>Untold wrote:</cite>EVERYTHING!<br /><br />This is what is suppose to be oldschool xen?<br /><br />It's nothing like xen!</div></blockquote><br />No, this is not supposed to be old-school Xenimus.  <span style="font-weight: bold">This is not a Xenimus clone, nor was it ever intended to be a Xenimus clone</span>.  Despite this unfortunately common misconception, Evidyon is only intended to capture what we believe old-school Xenimus got right--what made it exciting.  We believe that this lies primarily in the fast-paced, immediate-response, player-controlled action of play, and are doing our best to achieve that.<br /><br />You might fairly respond, &quot;but you haven't managed it.&quot;  To which the obvious answer is, &quot;we're still in Beta-minus-2:  we're working on it.&quot;<br /><br />If you have any thoughts as to how we might improve Evidyon, feel free to post them on the forums.  Please do keep in mind, though, that Evidyon is still very much a work in progress, and we can only address one issue at a time--so sometimes things that we <span style="font-style: italic">want</span> to have have to wait (e.g., a system of item props similar to Xenimus's:  we designed one back in May, but won't be able to implement it for a good while yet).  In other words, don't be surprised if we say &quot;great idea, but <span style="font-style: italic">not yet</span>.&quot;<br /><br />--I hope this clears up any misunderstandings you may have had about the project, and I look forward to seeing you around in-game and on the forums.<br /><br />Best,<br />Joe M.</div>
