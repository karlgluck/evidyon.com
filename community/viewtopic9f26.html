				<div class="content">Yes I actually installed that patch and it still didn't work karl <img src="./images/smilies/icon_razz.gif" alt=":P" title="Razz" /><br /><br />However, Cagen - The quick fix for me was to actually log onto that character who is BSOD'd on another computer.<br /><br />Or if it helps Karl, i think you should log onto the character whilst the BSOD is occuring upon logging in, then run something that can debug or trace exactly what is happening, when logging in?<br /><br />I don't know if you are still having BSOD on the character Cagen, but I think it might be worth trying that out Karl, but make sure the character is experiancing the BSOD first f all before logging onto it!<br /><br /><img src="./images/smilies/icon_razz.gif" alt=":P" title="Razz" /><br /><br />All the best,<br />Richard</div>

				<div class="content">Hmm...if there were two spots where that happened, it leads me to believe that it occurs due to the map being complex enough that it overflows a buffer.  I'll note it.</div>
