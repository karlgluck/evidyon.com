				<div class="content">So do I =)<br /><br />However, I suspect people are just lurking until the Beta release comes out since this version has been static/junky for a while now.<br /><br />I'm pleased to say that Beta is almost ready--the maps are designed, I got the first (really frickin sweet) dungeon up this evening, and all of the items are in place.  Unfortunately I can't spend a long time talking about how awesome it is since that takes time away from actually finishing its awesomeness.  We're all still here though!</div>

				<div class="content">Thats what we're shooting for.  It's looking like all the content can be in place at that point--the main thing we might not have time for is balancing (unfortunately) but that can take place during beta.</div>
