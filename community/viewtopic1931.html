I know it's not a big deal at all, but it still bugs the heck out of me when I look at my inventory and see &quot;aurelian corona&quot; next to &quot;Aurelian Sword.&quot;</li><li> It's difficult to pick items up:  you have to click on the exact spot, which can be difficult.  Perhaps it could be made less precise, or have an &quot;auto-loot&quot; function, press a key to loot the immediate (small-radius) area?</li><li> Items drag-able in inventory/storage, plz.</li><li>Ability to split stacks, plz</li><li>Consumable stacks:  moving to/from storage stacks don't get combined; when using, game pulls from first stack listed in inventory instead of (as would be preferable, for the sake of clean inventories) from stack with least (which should always be last stack listed in inventory once the problem with storage is fixed).</li></ul></li><br /><li>	<span style="text-decoration: underline">Monsters and NPCs</span><br /><ul><li> Dragons and Golems lack sound</li><li> More geolings, plz, to prevent crowding.</li></ul></li><br /><li>	<span style="text-decoration: underline">PCs</span><br /><ul><li> While attacking, Player cannot cast a spell while weapon is in mid-swing. This makes it difficult as Player has to time his spell casting or move to break out of attack-mode. Spell-casting should break Player out of attack-mode.</li><li> Melee combat:  Character's own attacks are paused when he is hit by Monster (not so much a problem for the Sorcerer, but for the Knight this can be annoying)--also prevents the use of special abilities such as Spin.  Is this a problem, or just a difficulty that requires some skill on the part of Player?</li><li> Knight spell Fireslash has no description.</li><li> &quot;Inventory Full&quot; message, plz.</li><li> <span style="color: gray">EXP share, plz.</span>  <span style="color: blue">Fixed for coming update (Apr13)</span></li><li> <span style="color: gray">/join has a <span style="font-style: italic">very</span> low radius, such that I have to attack someone to get close enough to join.</span>  <span style="color: blue">Fixed for coming update (Apr13)</span></li></ul></li><br /><li>	<span style="text-decoration: underline">Balancing</span><br /><ul><li> EXP relative to threat of monster is weird:  Trolls give &gt;2x than Forest Golems, Golems (esp. water/air) die real easy for the EXP they give</li><li> Vortex radius too large?</li><li> <span style="color: gray">Caster damage seems to be very low, or at least to not change with level/INT.</span>  <span style="color: blue">Fixed for coming update (Apr13)</span></li></ul></li><br /><li>	<span style="text-decoration: underline">Other</span><br /><ul><li> Doorway bug:  <!-- l --><a class="postlink-local" href="http://www.unseenstudios.com/community/viewtopic.php?f=22&amp;t=1341&amp;start=30#p9070">viewtopic.php?f=22&amp;t=1341&amp;start=30#p9070</a><!-- l --></li><li> Crowded trees make maneuvering difficult, for players but more importantly for monsters, making them ineffective.</li><li> Plants causing too much lag?</li></ul></li><br /></ul></div>

				<div class="content">Karl, my account has continued to freeze.  I don't know what it is, but it seems that out of my 4 characters, 2 will be frozen at once, and if I try to log in with them, the game freezes up.  The other 2 are fine, and then after a while they unfreeze.  It's weird.</div>

				<div class="content">Steals dont work, how the hell am i supoused to grind high lvl mobs?<br />Also with steals not working, my Geosid rejuvenation costs way to much, had like 997 hp before i realised i had no more heals and i lost a bejewled and a Devine aegis to the mobs.<br /><br />i grinded crawlers to get myself some gear which i could &quot;sacrefice&quot; but hell no my spirit dragon axe disappeared again, which leads me to believe that it has something to do with crawlers since it's the only spot where it has happened twice.<br /><br />Not much space between tree's to let golems attack you directly so they fly off all over the place.<br /><br />Golems look awsome:)<br /><br />Crypt at Gy is way to huge, what about making several small dungeons instead of one ginormous, like at the mountains &quot;Dragon lair&quot; or whatnot and one at Gy with harder skeletons down under.<br /><br />I still get stuck if i spam vortex/whirlwind, but now i also can spam without doing damage some times.<br /><br />Vortex: Vortex looks radius could be shortened to like the range of the sword, would look cooler and less wimpy than the thin circle.<br /><br />Grass looks like mini tree's lol and makes it hard to find gear.<br /><br />Bone gauntlet still has no stats.</div>
