<br />Agreed. I personally like the idea of the chests. But instead fill those chests with something else. Maybe like some random chest will have like an omni leather in it, but it'll vary every time it spawns. and it'll spawn maybe once every 2 days. It'll give people reasons to go for chests. I also motion for the game to be free. ^_^ Dunno if it is or not, If I have read about that, then it really slipped my mind.</div>

				<div class="content">the should not be free infact it should be more than xenimus... this way Karl G. has insentive to work on it instead of playing wow or some game lol..  I then more races, classes, better graphics, more items, more quests, more gear. Also there should be 3 servers. PV server 1 no killing at all for people level 1-20 trying to gain levels b4 getting pked. then you can choose which server u want to be in PV server 2 or 3 both are full PK servers. so this way there can be server battles or sumtin to make game more exciting. of course DS or each server. Also the &quot;new&quot; gear that EJ puts in the game is the same item but different color. example.. staff-magic staff, fire staff, lightning staff, sun staff. lol sword- lightning sword-spirit sword-omni sword-dirus sword. ites so boring make each one have its own special qualities. and make more robes for mages, and ol dplate mail look, i dont want a fuckign beer-belly i wanty rock hard abs dog! woot for old skoo! haha just some ideas ponder on them=) did i mention better graphics? xenimus needs them(not for characters though.</div>

<br />There should be SOME gear requirements. But they should be lax. If that level 1 got a fire sword why not use it. but that level 1 shouldnt be able to use mystic.
<br />As far as str, int, wis, requirements, i think they are okay, but should be made less severe.</div>

				<div class="content">i like the idea of having level requirements, not not restricting requirements, 
<br />like a lvl 20 could wear lvl 25 armor but the armor would only provide 80% protection something along the lines of a sliding equation i could figure something out but im tired, too much thinking. 
<br />
<br />i really like the idea of having 10-12 different props you can get but the weapon/armor will only permit 7 this will provide a great variety in gear in turn there will have to be alot of dropped gear good items, to allow for some bad proped gear.
<br />
<br />this does not apply to all gear levels just a beging thought
<br />(100/(lvl req)) x (your lvl) = armor effeciency
<br />lvl 25 armor on lvl 20 character
<br />100/25=4, 4x20=80%effciency</div>

				<div class="content">so will we use the 10-12 prp idea? cuz i like it but then you have to think, you pull a bad bum item for like 40 or something and your all pumped you go prp lets say o leather, you get prps like 7% ref 10 armor 2 hp regen 1% chance to blck 5dmg or som crap like that ya know? you should be able to go to the shrine or w/e and type -prop item(w/e you guys wanna make fo rhtis) and a screen props up and it looks something like this:
<br />
<br />*your item name here*
<br />
<br />*Current Propeties*
<br />-
<br />-
<br />-
<br />-
<br />-
<br />-
<br />-
<br />
<br />*Available Properties*
<br />-
<br />-
<br />-
<br />-
<br />-
<br />-
<br />-
<br />-
<br />-
<br />-
<br />-
<br />-
<br />
<br />and you have option of 
<br />
<br />*Predesigned Properties*
<br />(this is like 2mp 2hp 7% ref 10 armor like regular properties that can help every class regardless of skill specilization)
<br />
<br />*Custom*
<br />
<br />Also there is no % chance to fail it is what you choose. so If you have X # of rings + X # of opals/emeralds it = X # of properties added onto armor.  But if you have something like X # of rings + X # of opals/emeralds + X # of Black Pearls (so something worth more) it would = 1 premade prop (7prped) or custom 7prped. 
<br />
<br />In order for this to work you would need the system of proping items's names and how rare they are, what you would type to bring up proping screen. Also i think that it should be safe zone.
<br />
<br />
<br />what about this ?</div>

				<div class="content">Have you seen my theory of items? please see the thread entitled no remodelling or new modelling required. There is a certain easy way to ensure level one characters cannot use certain items and increase the amount of item possibilities,

<br />Player 1 DAMAGE: Has 6-10 (Sword+1)    Requires:  15str and 13 Agility
<br />
<br />Player2 DAMAGE: Has 12-15 (Sword+3)   Requires: 17 Str and 14 Agility

<br />Something like that, and the higher the level the diferent colours or glowing effects the item gets, this help to distinguish highest +level weapons and armours.</div>
