				<div class="content">Our little green friends might be underpowered, lots of HP and hardly any dmg, (on my lvl 30 warrior)<br /><br />I say <span style="font-style: italic">might</span> because I'm really hoping this is intentional.  Hunting there was so kick bum after I got surprised by their big anorexic friends. They seem to balance eachother out for making the area dangerous.  One thing I do want to say, If there are two archers on the screen my level 30 fig with 29 cons gets taken out before he can heal.  (It may just be that I'm not supposed to be there, but archers are massively more powerful than anything else in the area.)<br /><br />If there are two or more archers on the screen, it seems that some of my attacks/spells don't register.  I haven't confirmed this because I usually die very quickly, but I have trouble transing away when the archers show up on screen.  (They kill me so fast that my HP bar takes a moment to register it.)</div>

				<div class="content">Yea wtf are with the rock golems in south dungeon just at the entrance?  I've lost a good portion of my gear just trying to get stuff back cause I kept dieing there.  They damage like half of my life in a hit and take like 30 hits from me to kill one of them.  I had a mob of them around my death piles so I could never get them back because of insta death from them.  Can you reset back before the update?</div>

				<div class="content">I did not change them.  I even uploaded another update last night and they are still messed up.  All the game files say they are correct.<br />I don't know, I will look at it again tonight and see what is going on.  <br />I think they are tiered of being hunted by noobs so they gathered together and changed themselves to level 100's.  The only explanation I have for now.</div>

				<div class="content">So now I've basically lost everything I have plus massive experience penalty.  This game is unplayable.  Certain monsters are doing massive damage, and you lag out to the point that you log back on in the black abyss and you lost items and got experience penalty even when wearing an LSA ring.  Please reset back to before the updates were released.  This is ridiculous.</div>

				<div class="content">What would be rediculous is backsetting progress rather than fixing the update.  Remember, every time something fucks up in this game the developers come one step closer to perfecting the process.<br /><br />I'll be posting a new thread with all the major current gliches listed for convenience sake.</div>
