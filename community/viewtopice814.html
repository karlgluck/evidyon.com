				<div class="content">Like Karl said, we need to decide on what we, as a community, would like to see implemented first in the game:
<br />
<br /><blockquote><div><cite>Karl wrote:</cite> If it is possible, I'd like you guys to boil down a list of features you'd like to see implemented, in order, starting from a game that has essentially nothing once you log in other than the ability to walk around and talk to other players. This will aid me in which direction to take when coding.<br /><br />The intricacies of the game mechanics are fun to design, but right now we're missing some HUGE parts of the game that need to be constructed, such as how skills work, what skills people have, what races we're going to use, classes, class progressions, a (general) description of towns, .... </div></blockquote>
<br />
<br />I'm thinking something like this:
<br />
<br />Base Game -&gt; Races &amp; Classes -&gt; Stats -&gt; Items -&gt; Skills -&gt; Combat -&gt; ??
<br />
<br />Opinions, additions, subtractions?</div>

				<div class="content">After the basic walk around and communicate part, I would like to see things added in the following order.
<br />1. Implement the stat system. This includes playable races, classes, skills, hp mp, etc. Even if you cant DO anything with it. (like level up) All characters should have their stats &quot;frozen&quot; until the game is ready to actually play.
<br />2. Add basic non-aggresive NPS. Merchants mostly. (we prolly shouldnt even worry about guards for a while) The ability to interact (sell/buy) is essential. Even if there is nothing to buy or sell.
<br />3. Add items. we only need items up to a certain point at first, we can add stuff.
<br />4. Add monsters. Again, we only need a few at first. 
<br />By this time we have the whole newbie island together and the game is essentially ready to play.
<br />5. finish mapping the main world, unfreeze the stats, and have a general release. beta 1.</div>

				<div class="content">and scallion IS a vegetable... its a green onion.
<br />i knew that even before i played xen... (and i wouldve been like.. 11-12?)
<br />and what thad said is true. the fact that anyone can edit it means that serious people go through and edit out the stupid comments and such right after they are done.
<br />AND almost everything has an external source listed, which (usually) CANT be edited by everyone, so you can always double check.
<br />
<br />I think a name for scallion that is good would be based on reptile, or just some random word someone makes up.
<br />I would say Reptite, but thats from chrono trigger.. ;D
<br />Dreg... you could call it humanoid vs human, whereas its human-like, but not quite.</div>
