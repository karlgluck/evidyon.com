				<div class="content">I look forward to...<br />* Crash bugs being fixed. One completely locks up my computer and I have to restart windows every time. (Running XP)<br />* Stats having a clearer concept. Right now it's just weird? Adding a point into agility makes my HP go up. Why?<br />* Warriors getting some single attack abilities. Right now just spamming tornado is all you need to do.<br />* AoE spells hitting players?<br />* All commands listed. Like how to talk in guild, chat, attack all, attack monsters. Sticky to the top of one of the forums?<br />* Being able to turn off the helmet graphic. No offense to the modeler I just don't like wearing a helmet but still want the bonus. Haha.<br />* Small talent trees? Like Xenimus had.<br /><br />Can't think of anything else at the moment, but I'll post more when I can.</div>

				<div class="content">Yep, I'm definitely looking forward to that stuff too =)<br /><br />The party system shouldn't actually be working otherwise I would have added those comments.  The fact that it does anything at this point (and that it doesn't crash!) is nothing short of amazing...I thought I had disabled it O.o  Since I didn't, I'll just go ahead and add the notifications tonight.<br /><br />As for dragons...<img src="images/smilies/icon_biggrin.gif" alt=":D" title="Very Happy" /><br /><br /><br />Vapore:<br />- The confusion with stats is that nothing gets recalculated until you apply your next stat point.  I've fixed this for the next version to help remove this confusion.  Adding a point in agility doesn't make your HP go up, it just forced the game to recalculate your avatar's base stats and since your HP goes up naturally each level it appeared that adding a point to anything made your hp go up.<br />- Warriors will definitely be getting some cool abilities in the coming updates; I'm well aware of this one!<br />- /hidehelmet and /showhelmet are going up in this update<br />- aoe spells hit players if you say /all<br /><br /><br />I thought all client-side crash bugs had been fixed and I haven't seen anyone mention a problem until right now.  Can you guys elaborate?</div>

				<div class="content"><blockquote><div><cite>Karl G. wrote:</cite>I thought all client-side crash bugs had been fixed and I haven't seen anyone mention a problem until right now.

Upon landing I froze up. Couldn't alt+ f4. Couldn't restart. Couldn't do much of anything but move my mouse. Never happened when I ran Vista but I recently switched to XP.<br /><br />Maybe covering a large span of land in a short period of time causes this?</div>
