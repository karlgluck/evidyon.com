				<div class="content">Good to know.  It seems to be working well on that count.  One thing though:  I wasn't able to repeat the quest right away, but after I completed it the first couple times I got the &quot;come back when you're stronger message.&quot;  Is that supposed to happen, or should it be immediate?</div>

				<div class="content">I reported to the recipient after time had expired.  Obvious fail.  But then the sender wouldn't re-offer.  But when I give up the quest (either before or after the time expires), I can get the offer again.  Also, if I drop the letter on the ground it has no icon.  Oops.</div>
