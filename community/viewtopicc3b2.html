It also appears to be client side so everyones is different (not so much a bug but if the time of day in game was going to relate to game play it would be a problem [think opening shrines at midnight on Xen]).</li><li>Every time you open the chat box without typing anything it moves the text up a line.</li><li>Once you select a character all the text boxes go blank (this only happens on ONE of my accounts and not the others, it doesn't matter which character I choose from that account they all cause it). If you exit to the account log in screen nothing in functional and there is no text on the screen. Other people have had this happen with different criteria.</li><li>Giants have increased in size causing the gear on them to not display properly, helms and shields are off center.</li><li>Changing the view to top down causes all character models to disappear, light source is also off center.</li><li>If a menu screen is left open is already open, and you press enter to open up the chat log it over lays the chat log on top of the open menu screen. When you press enter to bring up the chat log, all other on screen menus should close (at least while we have the HUD as it is now).</li><li>Aspect ratio not correct for widescreen play. It looks fine i think until i log in to the character. But after i log in i can definatly tell that the resolution is not working properly. I have it set to 1280x800 and fullscreen. But it looks like its just stretching 800x600.</li><li>Base run speed for a newb is too slow.</li></ul><br /><span style="text-decoration: underline"><span style="font-weight: bold">Bugs carried over from 1.9</span></span><br /><br /><ul><li>Mobs <span style="font-weight: bold">STILL</span> spawn inside mountains/water.</li><li><span style="color: #80BFBF">When picking up items, placement into inventory seems to be random unless your inventory is cached on the server after logging out/a set period of time. ***Fixed but yet to be implemented.***</span><br />       </li><li>Inventory scroll bar does not reset to the top after you close and reopen the inventory window (the actual inventory does however). <br />   </li><li>When equipping items, inventory resets its self back to the top.<br />    </li><li>/respawn can respawn you off the safety square.<br />    </li><li>Player names/chat can be seen through in game screens.</li></ul><br /><span style="text-decoration: underline"><span style="font-weight: bold">Stuff that needs changing/adding</span></span><br /><br /><ul><li>MP regen could be increased slightly more while there are no consumables in game.</li><li>Global chat should always be visible.</li><li>Hitting enter to send a message should not close the chat log at the same time.<br />    </li><li>Scroll wheel should scroll through inventory.<br />    </li><li>Updater should tell the user they have the most up to date client if this is true.</li></ul><br /><span style="text-decoration: underline"><span style="font-weight: bold">Old bugs currently in testing/need testing</span></span><br /><br /><ul><li>Dead bodies sometimes slide across the map.</li><li>Mace has no stats heh.</li></ul></div>

				<div class="content">Fixed for 1.10.3 (released this morning)<br /><br />*  Dropped items after you die could do with staying on the ground longer, at least for the time being as we have no way to transport across the map and only having one spawn point. <br /><br />Also fixed, but not part of bug list:<br />- Jittering during attacking<br />- Movement speeds<br />- Attacking animations (I'm just playing with this right now...)</div>

				<div class="content">well, higher agility doesnt make you attack faster, doesnt speed up animation either, all gearon Giants is offcenter (shield is connected to Elbow, weapon connectd to wrist, helmet floats over head)<br /><br />also a big bug<br /><br /><br />if you alt tab out of game (i did this while at char select menu) it turns everything blank, and when you click a character name, it considers it as you have no characters, so your forced to make one, i didnt try maknig one yet, dunno if thatll cause a server error due to 6 chars on an account, also after getting the blank pages, if you go back to the main menu (without exiting game) you cant type acc numbers or passwords</div>

				<div class="content">-Aspect ratio not correct for widescreen play. It looks fine i think until i log in to the character. But after i log in i can definatly tell that the resolution is not working properly. I have it set to 1280x800 and fullscreen. But it looks like its just stretching 800x600.<br />-I get jitters when walking. Basically lag. Quite a bit. I dont having anything running on my computer that would cause it. So i guess its connection problems.<br />-I just had the client lock up on me when i was on. Was just killing some monsters stopped moving for a second, went to move again, and my mouse and keyboard did not respond. I tapped my windows key and start bar opened up. Clicked back on Evidyon in the task bar and it was on a black screen, tapped esc until it closed out. Loaded Evidyon back up and when i selected my character to log into, all the text disappeared. I knew what one was login anyway so i clicked it, and it loaded up just fine.<br />-Changing view makes characters disappear.<br />-If a menu is already open, and you press enter, it leaves the exiting menu open and brings up the hud. Causes strange overlapping. Pressing enter again should close out of any existing menu and bring the hud up, or if you have the hud open it should close the hud like it does now.<br /><br /><br />I'll tinker around a little bit more later.</div>

I am fine all throughout the day, but I was playing at about 1 AM this morning and started getting really bad jitters.  It's completely gone now.<br /><br /><blockquote><div><cite>speed3b wrote:</cite>-Changing view makes characters disappear.</div></blockquote><br />Yup; will be fixed.<br /><br /><blockquote><div><cite>speed3b wrote:</cite>-If a menu is already open, and you press enter, it leaves the exiting menu open and brings up the hud.

Pressing enter again should close out of any existing menu and bring the hud up, or if you have the hud open it should close the hud like it does now.</div></blockquote><br />Hahaha...yeah.  I didn't even consider this because I am usually only testing 1 thing at a time.  I'll try to fix this, but please test extensively to make sure it is fixed.</div>
