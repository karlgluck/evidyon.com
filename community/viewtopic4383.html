				<div class="content">I've had this same frustration.  I'm not sure what a good solution might be, though.  <br /><br />Perhaps a simple solution might be this:<br /><blockquote class="uncited"><div>A character has in his inventory a consumable which varies in degree, let's say it's a Large Red Potion.<br />There appears in his Use menu &quot;Large Red Potion,&quot; which he can key.<br /><span style="font-weight: bold">In addition</span>, there appear two new options:  &quot;Red Potion (All):  Large-&gt;Small&quot; and &quot;Red Potion (All): Small-&gt;Large.&quot;</div></blockquote><br /><br />This might be too cluttered, but it's the first way which occurred to me by which the obvious pitfalls might be avoided.</div>

				<div class="content">Something along the lines of what Joe was saying, have different  size potions assigned to the same key.<br />Also, have a priority list that the player can select which potions to consum first.  Kind of like some first person shooter games that I have played there is a list that has all of the in-game weapons and the player can select which weapons to auto-equip when picked up.</div>

				<div class="content">or just have it some what like xen and have a small potion for low lvls and like a maxi. <br />another problem is that you have to have a geo to get potions or ports. when u die and ur not guilded and run out of ports your basically SOL</div>
