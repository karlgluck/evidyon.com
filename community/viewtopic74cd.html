				<div class="content">well i was talking to karl and he said something that made me stray some thoughts, he said &quot;defense is not capped by any special number of defense it just lowers damage&quot;<br /><br />Correct me if im wrong here karl.<br />So x defense will lower y damage on Evidyon.<br />i entered a few other games i've tried, and saw defense in progress, it seems like x defence blocked y% damage no matter what health a player had example:<br /><br />dude has 100 health and 0% defense, if you attack him with a hit of 100 damage it will go right through and kill him.<br />dude has 100 health and 50% defense, 100 damage attack and he remains with 50 health.<br />does it work like this on Evidyon?<br /><br />What ive gathered of info from Evidyon:<br />Player has 600 health, and 500 defense(not that i know what amount it lowers), he gets struck with a hit for 600 damage and still dies one shot cause he has so low health? is it because evidyon defense reacts differently than other games?<br />and if it does why not make items with high defense harder to obtain and give less defense so that players can have f.ex the maximum of 40% lowered damage on them.<br /><br />and to add to that Xen's lower numbers so it is easier to understand.<br /><br />2200 health becomes 220.(maybe make hp a little higher vs weapons if you get what i say) <br />610 dmg becomes 61 dmg.<br /><br />Don't be mad cause ive pondered about balancing karl, i just find it more exiting than bugs.<br />bugs can be fixxed, gameplay will gain or lose players.</div>

				<div class="content">We discussed lowering the numbers, but (1) higher numbers give more room for a variety of weapons and (2) as my brother pointed out, we don't want to move toward the Runescape system where level 70 characters do 4 damage.  That's an extreme example, but I'd rather err on the side of numbers that are too big than ones that are too small.</div>
