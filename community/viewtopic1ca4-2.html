				<div class="content">I really liked the aurelian set you did, but this azure doesn't place a thought in my mind about how azure gear would look like...<br /><br />The definition of azure:<br />1. of or having a light, purplish shade of blue, like that of a clear and unclouded sky.  <br />2. Heraldry. of the tincture or color blue. <br /><br />Mostly it's like a bit darker than sky blue.<br /><br />For some reason I've pictured &quot;Azure&quot; to also have relevance to lightning... perhaps the shield could be round, with a darker blue rim, lighter blue texture towards the inside, with an even lighter blue animated lightning bolt (kind of how ominex was) on the middle of the shield. A ring around the lightning bolt of the same color of the bolt, with little curved spikes (not protruding) spiraling out just a slight bit from the middle ring, and the outer ring can have the same curved spikes spiraling toward the inside of the shield...<br /><br />I'll see if I can draw up an example... if you guys don't mind I help with the ideas for the azure concept... for now here's a crap MSPaint example.<br /><br />By the way... what's so special about the azure gear? Isn't it going to be extremely weak? Doesn't seem like a type of gear set to be really weak, especially if it only raises your mp or whatever.<br /><br />CRAP MSPAINT DRAWING<br /><img src="http://img.photobucket.com/albums/v354/DracoX2/azure.png" alt="Image" /></div>

				<div class="content">I redid my thought on the azure shield...<br /><br />I thought the other one looked a bit annoying, and it wasn't anywhere near my ideal thought for the shield... besides, the previous thought looked more like a solar-based shield type.<br /><br />Here's something a bit closer to what I was thinking... After I did this I thought maybe the spikes on the edges could be more narrow, and the darkblue in the middle closer to black, with a nice thin rim for the outer edge.<br /><br /><img src="http://img.photobucket.com/albums/v354/DracoX2/azure2a.png" alt="Image" /></div>

				<div class="content">I agree, i like dracos design but the flash looks irritating. You better had taken the picture without flash, ahua. ;]<br /><br />How about to use dracos design but with thaddys tree instead of the flash? That would not only be a fuzzy funky compromise but also look pretty good.</div>

				<div class="content">Admittedly, this is difficult to do without a full list of items that will be in the game. All these armors could be newb stuff so far. Should a level 1 item look like it offers more protection that a level 25 armor? You also have to take into account what each set offers, as in protection, bonuses, and abilities. Azure gives wisdom and mp or something along those lines doesn't it? To me, that should me more mage-like with a scale armor and a small shield.</div>

I'd love to have you do a set of armor--I'm mostly in need of creative weapons/shields/helmets right now and you have free license to come up with interesting designs <img src="./images/smilies/icon_biggrin.gif" alt=":D" title="Very Happy" /></div>
