				<div class="content">Now that the engine is starting to show life and were getting ready to add in content, what direction should PV be going? At one point I remember this being a Xenimus &quot;clone&quot;, going back to the &quot;better&quot; days of Xen, but we also see new features that are making PV a game in its own.<br /><br />Open discussion, what do you all think should be the direction of PV?<br /><br />Personally I like the direction Karl has been taking-- making it his own. I believe we can really build a great game and blow past Xenimus in all respects, from gameplay to graphics.</div>

				<div class="content">Of course it shouldn't be a clone.  As I understand, PV was always intended to use old-style Xen as a starting point from which to build an all-around better game that preserves the fast-paced top-down action and sense of exploration and mystery that made Xen so exciting.</div>

				<div class="content">The way Karl is taking the game is the best choice. Its like when ej was making xenimus, he came to a fork in the road, well he didnt have gps or a map so he took the wrong road. Karl decided to bring his tomtom with him and turned the right way, and is doing the things ej should have been doing this whole time. Listening to the players who know the game, asking for advice, and coming up with good ideas. And ejs stuck out in b.f.e.</div>

				<div class="content">Agreed, and by making a &quot;new game&quot; based off of old xen and user input, there are more options. No more lava imps!!!!!</div>
