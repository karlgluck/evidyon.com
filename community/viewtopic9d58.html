<br />Dude. The reason I still do play xenimus is because of the gameplay. When PV is out, it'll be because of Gameplay AND graphics. This game is going to fucking pwn, don't worry. Tons of people will be playing, and karl and the team will be richer then EJ</div>

<br />
<br />If you take a look at the map maker models thread in this forum you can see some of the models I have made
<br />(keep in mind they were made TO look like xenimus. I could make much much more detailed models)</div>
