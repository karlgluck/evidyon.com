				<div class="content">id like to suggest a removal of most of the trees ingame they are rather bothering me and the swamp used to be such a awsome grinding spot cause all the mobs would come to you instead of being stuck in a fucking tree.<br /><br />if you read this and feel the same say &quot;Aye&quot;<br /><br />Nr.1 in a forest trees dont grow that close, cause they would ruin eachothers water supplies, making this unlogical ingame.<br /><br />Nr.2 so many monsters get stuck in the tree's making you have to put extra effort just to get that one running away cause it crashed.<br /><br />Nr.3 players cant move freely cause trees are in the way, before we could cordinate through them instead of crashing into a wall of trees.<br /><br />Nr.4 before when there were not many trees we would have problems with mobs dying beneath them and hiding loot from the naked eye, well imagine now that theres more trees?<br /><br />Nr.5 Golems, well unless it is a forest golem what are they doing in the forest? <br />i thought water golems would fit to the sandhopper enviroment.<br />Fire golems should be near some kind of volcano &quot;with lava dmg us if we went inn&quot;<br />Earth golems should be underground.<br />Stone golems near the mountain feet.(like they already are only less trees and kinda like the ogres had it on xen)<br />Air golems should be near some hotsprings/geysirs?<br />And what better place to put Death golems but beneath the graveyard in the huge fucking dungeon?(which could be downsized)<br /><br />With all these ideas you get to create a bigger continent instead of overcrowding certain areas with different types of monsters you can put them wherever you want in different zones, and not only that, you could have an elemental sorceror Boss spawning all these different types at the same time.<br /><br />And just to add, the grass its to much, maybe some flowers like red blue and yellow etc, but the grass its just to much.<br /><br />Carnage out <img src="images/smilies/icon_smile.gif" alt=":)" title="Smile" /></div>

				<div class="content">Aye.<br /><br />I remember PvPing in Xenimus against mages and they would constantly teleport between trees. Made PvP oh so boring and unfair.<br /><br />Oh and I was a warrior. Charging around a tree &lt; teleporting.</div>

				<div class="content">I agree the trees are a bit much at the moment.  Those areas are...very leafy to say the least.  That combined with the dopey AI doesn't make such a great combo <img src="images/smilies/icon_razz.gif" alt=":P" title="Razz" />  Thanks for the note I'll see what I can do!</div>

It's okay to have a buncha tree's if you can actually do somthing to get around them and stuff (Like CoH/CoV when you get your travel power <img src="images/smilies/icon_biggrin.gif" alt=":D" title="Very Happy" />) but in this it's a little aggravating..</div>
