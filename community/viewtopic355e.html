				<div class="content">I looked into the problem this morning and I found that the server's IP address had changed...which is weird because I thought it was static.  Anywho, I've mucked up the client a little since the release trying to get it to debut it on everyone's system so I have to undo some of that tonight, change the IP over and recompile then I'll send out the new version.
<br />
<br />Moral of the story:  don't make assumptions.  <img src="./images/smilies/icon_smile.gif" alt=":)" title="Smile" /></div>

				<div class="content">the servers ip is dynamic, but the no-ip.org address I gave you will always point to the correct address, so perhaps make it always resolve that address to get the IP?</div>
