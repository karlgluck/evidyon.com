				<h3>Game Mechanics: XP loss (update)</h3>

				<div class="content">When you die you should lose some XP. My idea is this (feel free to make suggestions/amendment of course) 
<br />WHen you die, you lose you level% of xp with no cap
<br />If you are level 12, you lose 12% of your XP. When you are level 25, you lose 25% of your XP. 
<br />However, what XP you lose should not be actually deducted from your XP. Instead it should be added to an XP debt counter that must be completely made up before you can gain XP again. 
<br />
<br />So, (using easy numbers here.) 
<br />If you are level 10 with 10,000 XP and you die. 
<br />You still have 10,000 XP but you know have 1000XP debt.  (again, these are fake numbers. 10,000 XP is like level 6 or something)
<br />If you have XP debt, you should gain XP at a 2X to 3X rate. So a monster than normally gives 10XP would clear up 20 to 30 points of XP debt. 
<br />So with 1000XP debt you only really have to gain like 3500 to 5000 XP to clear it. 
<br />Having XP debt should have some kind of penalty, like unable to take on/complete quests.
<br />
<br />update:
<br />It may be a good idea to cut that in half. So a level 10 only loses 5% of their exp. a level20 will lose 10% of their exp. etc. 
<br />This depends on what levelingXP formula we choose.</div>

				<div class="content">that would be too hard to get back. being lvl 40 and having lets say 20mill exp you would loose 8 mill exp. that would be way too much. even with 2x or 3x exp gain.especially since you got a class (warlock) who would only loose exp 1 out of 1000 times because of pop. personally i would like to get the 100k exp loss back, that would be much easier to get back (ofc) and would make pvp a bigger part of the game cause you wont be to afraid of exp loss (even tho the item loss would be a bigger worry) but you wont get screwed double over atleast.
<br />
<br />just my point tho</div>

<br />
<br />Very few people if any will reach level 40 in project volucris. 
<br />The high xp loss is intentionally harsh in order to keep the levels lower. If you have an alternative formula please post it.</div>

				<div class="content">how about losing a percentage per level. not quite sure on how to explain it but if your level 50 and you lose 50% fo your exp... I'd rather go play regular xen, lol.
<br />
<br />Let me see how to explain my idea.
<br />
<br />if your level 31 and going for 32 and you lsoe exp you will lose the precentage (31%) of the exp you have gaine din between those 2  levels. or something like that.</div>

				<div class="content">nah, never played it. im just saying. being level 80 and having (just as an example) a level 30 spell from xen... kinda sucks. i think the leveling is fine just need to be tweak of how much exp is needed after level 60. like 100mil to level is insane. besides that its fine, and new spell system is very nice. just needs to have spells that every one loves (agredi, cross bomb) put into it.</div>

				<div class="content">alright then. So long as we areon the same page. I mean, we can HAVE imps and stuff, but they just cant give as much exp, or be as hard. 
<br />I want to set up a system where most people that play the peak in the teens. Most characters should get to 16-20 and not get too far past that. Only the most dedicated, obsessive people get to achieve 26-35 range. After 35, leveling should be the most painful of chores.</div>

				<div class="content">so we have mystic chests at lvl 20 again? how will powerlvling be? castles being good to lvl in again?
<br />and the exp loss is in my idea insane. it was damn hard to lvl thats ok, and ofc my lvl 40 suggestion was just and example,
<br />but losing the percentage of your exp for your lvl is gonna make people not play it too long. eiffels idea I personally think is more
<br />suited for a game with so few lvls. 
<br />
<br />Also a problem is, when this game comes out: you will prob have a big lagg on them and sometimes they will fall out, making people die/losing exp.
<br />this will prob be a starting problem wich can be fixed by charging more for playing etc, but will you add something that will make people who lose gear/exp to
<br />a problem server side get their things back or just disable it in the start? cause it might be a big problem and making people quit way to early.
<br />
<br />and btw, ill rather play ur game then xen how it is now. like this forum, why havent ej just made a forum for himself where players could actully post problems to him instead
<br />of mailing them to him.</div>
