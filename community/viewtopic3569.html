Beta is a nice acronym for Balancing, Equilibrium, Testing, and Analysis.  We realize that there are damage adjustments that need to be made in the game; however, we want to gather adequate amounts of data from players killing monsters (all damages, kill times, xp rates, etc. are tracked by the server) and analyze it before we make such a drastic change to overall damage for a class.<br /><br />Thxxxxx!<br /><br />~Erich</div>

If we adjusted magic damage right now without first having the basis knowledge of correct damages for melee characters, all it would result in is more whining =P<br /><br /><blockquote><div><cite>Morn wrote:</cite>It's a beta release and if I understand right, they are still in college and/or working on top of creating this game.

If you think you're too slow, you might try raising your Agility--that will speed up your attacks by a lot.</div>
