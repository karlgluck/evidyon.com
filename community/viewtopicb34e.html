				<div class="content">So you may have noticed that I haven't been around for the last week or so.  All the time I'd put into getting Evidyon ready for the big release (and fixing bugs afterward for the next one) finally caught up with me.  I haven't really slept more than 5 hours a night since last Saturday...but this weekend I've managed to clear up my schedule so that I can advance Evidyon and put out an update on Sunday.</div>

				<div class="content">And if anyone wants to know what was competing with the update this weekend...I remembered I have a huge presentation for my research project this week and had to make some source material.  Here's a mini-pic of the robot that I created as rendered by the CAD program SolidWorks, just for fun.  The full-size picture prints out at at about 5 feet long <img src="./images/smilies/icon_razz.gif" alt=":P" title="Razz" /></div>
