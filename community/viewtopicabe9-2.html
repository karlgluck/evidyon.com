<br />I don't think imps should EVER be in game.
<br />-port is kinda dumb, if this concept is added it should be a choice
<br />
<br />-HELL YES to old look of Daemons
<br />-Old look of volucris
<br />-HELL YES to attack run glide, but that was a bug so it might be hard to redo lol
<br />-Gear should be sold at the old price. Ej cut selling prices in half.... so stupid.
<br />-Old mystic bone mail look.
<br />-Yes to square, should reflect damage like the old days too, sure it was annoying but it was Essence De Xenimus
<br />-Old ground texture, the scracthy type
<br />-Old Font
<br />-NO MAP (annoying, but essence de Xenimus, you had to know your way around and it should be that way with the new map. This leads to more exploring, more fun, and better game play)
<br />-Old skill system
<br />-Merchant Ayor w00t</div>

				<div class="content">I like the map.  It certainly led to more exploring for me.  Since I never really spent long periods of time on xen, I never really got to know the areas.  So I'd look at the map, find an area I didn't know (&quot;hey, I wonder what's on that island?&quot;), and go check it out.  I'd usually die, but it was a lot of fun.  Any way, certain areas could always not show up on the map, if they needed to be hidden.</div>

<br />The map is stupid, what's the point in exploring if it's all mapped out for you. 
<br />
<br />The old ground texture is part of the essense of old Xen, that's what this project is all about.
<br />
<br />
<br />Also, the ring you're thinking of is ring of contravenenum (rcv, oh god I haven't heard that in soooo long)
<br />
<br />All old rings:
<br />Scientia Ring
<br />Salubris Ring
<br />Sautaris Ring
<br />Tueri Ring
<br />Ring of Contravenenum
<br />Vis Animus Ring
<br />Vis Mederi Ring
<br />Vis Tueri Ring
<br />Omnispiritus Ring</div>

<br />old ground looks like poo, i have no problem with the fact that xenimus has gotten better graphics over the years, its the change in gameplay i didnt like. I think the map wouldnt be that bad, it dont show whats there just shows where grass is and stuff and where islands are, it sucks having to swim for hours to find all the islands lol.</div>

<br />If you don't like the grass you can change textures anyway, but I'm sticking with the fact that the map is utterly stupid.</div>

				<div class="content">Alright, Here is my opinion about some things. Cons needs to disappear... I am all for bringing life back to the death square. As for game graphics... I don't think reverting back to the old ones will help game play. In fact I believe that the repitition of the scenery needs to be taken care of. 
<br />
<br />I think what made xenimus decay was the repetition of everything, I mean really.. all you do now is lvl up, and then fight higher lvls... There are no rewards for exploration... Treasure Chests are next to pointless except for your pulls... why did he put so many of them on the game if all you can ever get out of them besides your pulls are &quot;magic staff, white pearls, leather armor&quot; If you can make it through difficult dungeons and make it to a treasure chest... then you should be rewarded imo. There is just too much blank space on the map....</div>

<br />
<br />i agree xen it too much the same thing lvling and pvping... xen has a total of 4-5 good quests... and pulls suck! never gotten a good pull in 3 years... 
<br />
<br />there should be a map screen you fill in yourself. roads between citys should be mapped but nothing else.</div>
