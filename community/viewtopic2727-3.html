<br />I really dig the way of using images as the 'basic' source for a map.
<br />
<br />Edit: Damn is this handy and fun, that's pure awesomeness in editorform, here's my first test:
<br />
<br /><a href="http://imageshack.us/photo/my-images/174/testotest1zi6.jpg/" class="postlink"><img src="../../img74.imageshack.us/img174/9804/testotest1zi6.th.html" alt="Image" /></a>
<br />
<br />
<br />Now for some more complex testing, the following map includes four different layers, custom textures in different sizes and formats, and a manually edited part (the 'sq' at the left bottom):
<br />
<br /><a href="http://imageshack.us/photo/my-images/214/test2zf5.jpg/" class="postlink"><img src="../../img214.imageshack.us/img214/6307/test2zf5.th.html" alt="Image" /></a>
<br />
<br />Btw, how are walls handled? I used a terrain layer with a wooden texture and marked it as 'high wall', but when i press 'v' to change the view it's still flat (marked red in navigation though). Does it need a mesh?</div>

				<div class="content">Cool, walls work. I also tried making a roof via a terrain layer, but failed there. I guess it has to do with a terrain not being able to have anything 'under' it (reminds me of good ol' doom).

<br />Making triggers and scripting points isn't possible yet, right? (or was i being blind there?)
<br />I ask because i thought about making doors or a dungeon-entrance.
<br />
<br />Btw i have a kinda broken graphics card in my compy here so i couldn't test any meshes yet (polygons get displayed with nasty errors here, but that has nothing to do with the editor, only with my card), so i'll leave you a mesh-less town, guess which one it is ^^ :

				<div class="content">If you use the bulk import tool for .X meshes, the textures should be in the same directory.  If you want to add everything individually, do this:
<br />
<br />Add your textures as Images
<br />Create Static Texture definitions for the Images
<br />Add your models
<br />On the Skins menu, use Create Unique Skin for Meshes and select all of your meshes
<br />For each entry in every skin's Map member, right-click on the Texture Reference and select the texture to assign
<br />Create Scenery for each of the meshes, and be sure to assign a Skin for them (or they won't show up)

				<div class="content">Just thought about another thing (i hope i'm not coming off as impertinent here hehe):
<br />
<br />Currently the maps cannot be made 'curvy', meaning all diagonal ways are looking kinda blocky. That could be solved by using textures with transparent parts (there's a triangular 'dirt'-texture in xenimus for example), does the editor support textures like that? (i found something with alpha-channel but couldn't figure out what it does)
<br />

				<div class="content">I really like the skull one <img src="images/smilies/icon_smile.gif" alt=":)" title="Smile" />
<br />
<br />The editor does support transparent regions/color keys, but if you import dirtover from Xenimus and try to use it, you'll end up with transparent areas that show the background color (light blue) instead of some other texture.  This has because this is a tough issue to solve--I'll explain next.
<br />
<br />First of all, I solved the problem last time by hard-coding the dirt-over stuff into the editor (if a fluid bordered dirt, it automatically generated the right kind of dirt overlay).  This worked well because it was automatic--no need for you to go around your thousands of tiles of coastline and change every single one.  This was a temporary solution at best, and something I hoped to fix with the new editor.
<br />
<br />In this editor, there are multiple ways of solving the problem.  I could make the dirt-over automatic, as I did before, but that doesn't seem right because it ties the editor to specific content--and the whole point of this editor is to promote flexibility.  So another solution would be to introduce a second Map Layer list under Atlas called &quot;Map Overlay&quot;.  These layers would be applied on top of the layer below and could be used for all sorts of fun things, such as roofs on buildings, in addition to the regular map information definition.  The problem with that would be how to update the overlay when you, say, add a new island.  There could be a command to generate the overlay, but it would difficult not to make it erase any specific changes you make to the overlay on the coastline.  What's more, you'll have to specify some sort of pattern for it to work off of (i.e. tell the program, &quot;hey, if you have any one of these dirt ground types to the north of a water block and, any of these dirt types to the west of it, put this west-north overlay on top of the water).
<br />
<br />
<br />Hmm...actually that rules thing isn't a bad idea.  It could be used to import these textures, which contain blending between grass and bush-like textures, for example:
<br /><!-- m --><a class="postlink" href="http://www.lostgarden.com/2006/02/250-free-handdrawn-textures.html">http://www.lostgarden.com/2006/02/250-f ... tures.html</a><!-- m -->
<br />
<br />(P.S. Try using those in the editor, they look really good!)</div>
