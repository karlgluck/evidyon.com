				<div class="content">I don't have a lot of experience with message board creation, and it doesn't look like many other people here do either.  I might suggest that you go through forum creation sites and see what you might like in the new forum.  Then discuss it here so that other people can see what kind of considerations go into the creation.  I think this will inspire a little more feedback.</div>

				<div class="content">Is world chat going to include both gameplay and casual topics?<br />Are you accepting applications for moderators?<br /><br />Are you thinking of limiting vulgarity, if so recomment NOT creating a vulgarity permissable forum as xentales did, in order to protect board content quality.  I think the untrackable and unmoderated speech in the game is well enough, and not likely to be cared about by parents of most younger demographics, but a vulgar forum representing the game could turn many concerned families into finding the game unsuitable.  I know that many families these days game together (my own family all have active Runescape accounts and I know many households where Warcraft is a family pasttime.) I'm not trying to be a prick about this suggestion, but I feel that we can definitely learn from the xentales mistakes.</div>

				<div class="content">For board administration/moderation you will need to talk to my brother, if he doesn't reply to this soon I'll ask him about it and try to get you some info.  <img src="images/smilies/icon_smile.gif" alt=":)" title="Smile" /><br /><br />World Chat in this board is described as anything about <span style="text-decoration: underline">game events</span>. I can't speak for my brother, but I think it would be more organized to have a forum for game related topics and a forum for real life/&quot;casual&quot; related topics. I supposed there's also the possibility for having only game-related topics on the entire board.</div>
