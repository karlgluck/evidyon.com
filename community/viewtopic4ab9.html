				<div class="content">If anyone has any requests for models they want for their maps lemme know and I'll create them.
<br />A little artistic direction would be nice too (picture, description, and what textures you might want would be nice)
<br />
<br />I actually have most of the xenimus terrain models made from scratch already for anyone that is interested.
<br />(I should probably put together a pack with the skins and stuff in .X format)</div>

<br />I bought these medieval models a while back and I'm going to be distributing it as soon as I find a way to pack up the resources into a format that fits the EULA--it says I can't distribute the models in their original format.  But actually, this gave me a GREAT idea!
<br />
<br />I'm going to make some &quot;Resource Pack&quot; methods for the editor (Create and Import) that will let you pack up images, textures, models and what-not into a single flat file that can then be used by the editor.  This is actually quite easy to do because of the DirectCraft library I wrote--it shouldn't take more than an afternoon.  This way, anyone creating resources can just generate one of these Resource Packs, and people can import the pack and already have the models, textures, images, scenery, terrain, etc...set up and ready to go without any more hassle.
<br />
<br />That's on the to-do list now <img src="./images/smilies/icon_smile.gif" alt=":)" title="Smile" />
<br />
<br />
<br />
<br />
<br />Aaaaanyway, we really need more outdoor scenery models and textures.  Trees, plants, blades of grass, funny swamp rushes, vines on sticks, crops, cacti, etc...the model pack had none and none of the ones I've been able to find online are any good at ALL so I've been using Xenimus's models....which are not wonderful either.</div>
