				<div class="content">I don't know about tonight, but i thought i had read that either Karl or Joe were talking about some kinda item update. I'm hoping they'll see the post soon and restart the server, but they're prolly still busy finishing up school stuff. So i don't know when the server's liable to be back up.</div>

				<div class="content">Restarted.<br /><br />Sorry that took so long!  My last serious final was today, so I was out at the movies.  <span style="font-style: italic">Star Trek</span>.  Surprisingly good!  I laughed a lot.<br /><br />Items update is scheduled for next week.  It'll be a big one:  a complete re-structuring of the item system, including a lot of behind-the-curtain work that will make the dev work a hell of a lot easier come Beta, and it's very expandable and flexible, so that it will allow us to create better items consistently (as you can tell, the ones in the game right now are rather ... jury-rigged).  Unfortunately this means that you can't keep your current items!  But we'll include some kind of a conversion, so you'll get new items roughly equivalent to the ones you have now.  I also hope that we'll be able as part of this update to address the drop rate and make it even a *little* bit sensible, because it's clearly mucked up right now--what I was saying about jury-rigging.  We'll also be rolling out the Economy features with the next couple updates.<br /><br />And we're all finished with finals!  (at least the real ones, you know--the ones that require study).  So things are going to speed up starting next week.   <img src="./images/smilies/icon_biggrin.gif" alt=":D" title="Very Happy" /></div>

I have a weekend of scuba certification ahead of me otherwise I'd start tomorrow &gt;.&lt;<br /><br />Also, I'm pushing out an update before noon tomorrow come hell or high water.  Stay tuned.</div>
