				<div class="content">I'm considering creating a guild of theory testers and explorers.  Information would be our currency.  I'd like to have this guild up and off the ground before the expansion so that we can work as a team.<br /><br />Information discovered by one or two members would be the property of the players who discovered it, they would not be required to share discoveries with the guild, so long as they were contributing information from their specialty field.  Primarily guild activity would consist of discussion on our own private forum and group excursions into new areas.  I'm thinking rules along the lines of, no intentionally posting misleading information.  (Anywhere, in order to protect the integrity of the guild.) Don't just <span style="font-style: italic">give</span> away guild discoveries.<br /><br />There will be no insufficient thinkers, you have to have some kind method of contribution.  Creating and testing theories is the most common way to contribute, but I do have a wish list.<br /><br />Map Writers<br />Programmer<br />Experienced Party Leaders<br />Guide Writers<br /><br />If you're interested or think this guild might have some potential, PM me.</div>
