				<div class="content">This goes along with the portal debate, but here's something I'd like to implement:  a &quot;beacon&quot; that can be set on/off by someone in your party that allows you to port to their location.  This could be a method of combating port-pking--if someone knows that if they port-pk, their whole party will come and kick bum, they might be less inclined to do so (or it might make it more risky!)<br /><br />Also, on a personal note--I liked the availability of port-pking (even though I got port pked and lost a lot of items that way...) because it was a way to get back at higher level characters with little risk to yourself.</div>

				<div class="content">I like that idea, gives parties/gilds/links more practical use.<br /><br />If you like to have port-pking in the game you pretty much answered your porting question then though, because it would only work with a porting-system 98% similar to xenimus.</div>
