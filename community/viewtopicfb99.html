				<div class="content">Just dont understand why you couldnt keep expanding Alpha and add the new races/classes to that system?... cause ghad i was looking forward to something with the feel of xen, i must admitt you lost it with pre beta, its something entirely different.</div>

They had different <span style="font-style: italic">textures</span> on the same character.  The Modeling Update will contain actual armors that look badass if I do say so myself  <img src="images/smilies/icon_razz.gif" alt=":P" title="Razz" /> <br /><blockquote class="uncited"><div>Cool looking &amp; great spells, which worked.</div></blockquote><br />New spell system = new particle effects.  This is just aesthetics and as far as I know Karl is working on hardcore code right now, not polishing the look<br /><blockquote class="uncited"><div>Actually had a fucking town.</div></blockquote><br />QQ? =) Again, just a map thrown together.<br /><blockquote class="uncited"><div>normal ressurection.</div></blockquote><br />I don't get what you're saying by this.  Your items are unequipped when you die now, but that's about all that changed<br /><blockquote class="uncited"><div>two awsome classes, Knight/sorcerer</div></blockquote><br />We have expanded the amount classes (maybe more than you can play right now ;D)<br /><blockquote class="uncited"><div>Whirlwind was a perfect spell, until you added the new one which i cant even remember(shouldnt made it so fancy btw)</div></blockquote><br />New spell system.  The new one isn't designed for level 20 being endgame.<br /><blockquote class="uncited"><div>Dungeons</div></blockquote><br />Thrown together map.<br /><blockquote class="uncited"><div>Noticable gear</div></blockquote><br />Didn't you say this already?  They were textures, not armors.  New models have boots as well <img src="images/smilies/icon_biggrin.gif" alt=":D" title="Very Happy" /><br /><br /><br />pre-beta has: <br /><blockquote class="uncited"><div>New models which are awsome but should be monsters not playable races, According to lore there are dwarfes, humans dunno what more but not playable wolf races etc <img src="images/smilies/icon_smile.gif" alt=":)" title="Smile" /></div></blockquote><br />Models have changed to be more human-like for the Modeling Update.  Also: genii = geonans, men = humans, giants = dantalions .. I suppose we should change the words on that page to include LUCANS and VOLUCRIS.  Ghuh.  Calling them wolf and bird races.. they have names.. =P<br /><blockquote class="uncited"><div>a flawed damage/pvp system</div></blockquote><br />A cleaner code base/expandable upper-limit pvp system that can be balanced more easily than alpha's<br /><blockquote class="uncited"><div>crystal system(thumbs up)</div></blockquote><br />yay!<br /><blockquote class="uncited"><div>Guild system(thumbs up)</div></blockquote><br />yay!<br /><blockquote class="uncited"><div>A fucking working multi shot system</div></blockquote><br />yay!<br /><blockquote class="uncited"><div>many more wepons</div></blockquote><br />which are part of an item spread designed for expandability of the upper-levels<br /><br /><br /><br />Alpha, as I've said many times to many of the whiners about pre-beta who all have the same basic complaints:<br />1) Alpha coding was choppy as hell, Karl has been working very hard on making tools and cleaning code for a better-running and smoother game<br />2) Alpha graphics had body textures, yes, but Beta will have body <span style="font-style: italic">armors</span><br />3) Alpha had too much time spent on it for polishing and not enough time for what it was actually for - helping us work out bugs and implementing new code<br />4) Alpha had terrible unit pathing, but Beta will have a new system for monster chasing as well as (hopefully ready in time) &quot;grouped&quot; monsters<br />5) Alpha had only melee monsters, but Beta will have spell-casting, ranged, and crazy-go-nuts AI monsters!<br /><br />All in all - <span style="font-weight: bold">complaining won't help.  Bug reports and suggestions for (non-drastic) changes you would like to see will!</span><br /><br />We love our players and our community and we're trying to move forward together.  Please keep your comments constructive and optimistic.<br /><br />If you don't feel like doing that, just wait for Beta when the polishing/balancing will be pretty much all we have left to do!<br /><br /><br />&lt;3<br />~Erich</div>

				<div class="content">Not complaints Joe.<br /><br />And i did talk to karl after posting this, and he told me to at least give him the same amount of time he put into alpha before i was to complain, so some months.<br /><br />and Erich, as for the ressurection, i cant recall actually logging on and being on the ground, even when im not dead to begin with on alpha.<br /><br />i like Erichs costumer support, he kinda notices that im not out to make you guys look bad, somehow i feel joe, karl are getting a little moody, meaning Erich is my new best friend! yay!</div>

If I would have known it was up and running I would have been a helpful tester.. I only got the play alpha for 2 days right before it was taken down for pre-beta release.. the whole time I was on I only seen 1 other player and it wasn't you. Just play the game.. report the bugs you find..  you don't have to force your ideas on anyone...</div>
