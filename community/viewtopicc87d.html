				<div class="content">My class is doing a project to raise money for a school in Congo, Africa. We'd really appreciate it if you helped spread the word. Our website is <!-- w --><a class="postlink" href="http://www.congoaid.info/">http://www.congoaid.info</a><!-- w --> 
<br />
<br />If people click the google ad at the top, it gives us $0.40 per click! Also there's a donation page, and things to buy. It all goes towards the school. So please click the ad, and spread the word. We'd really appreciate your participation, it means a lot to us, it really does.
<br />
<br />If you have any questions the phone number of the teacher, school, and emails are in there. Also the school's webpage is there.</div>
