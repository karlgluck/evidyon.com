				<div class="content">Well i posted somewhat what i thought the knight dmg and the Sorceror dmg should be, and im thinking again now that the Knight dmg should be increased but Sorcerer of course gets some more spell dmg cause of his low hp pool.<br /><br />The dmg they recieve for each STR and INT point should not be so very different but the sorcerer will of course gain more cause he gains less from constitution.<br />which will make the game balanced in pvp.<br />Also i dont know if Whirlwind works like intended, it kinda misses all the time and it takes a while with the best sword ingame to kill just one, ive got the spirit sword.<br /><br />Well i do recall that we had props ingame and that we did get more damage from each intel stat we had, but i also remember getting damage from items.<br />And for a paladin/fighter the main damage would come from wether you found a imba dmg weapon not if you had much str though that would benefit you aswell.<br />This way of letting the player find good items encourages grinding for better weapons and armors to get the pluss damage they gave you also special weapons like dispel axe(which removed buffs) and acid axe(which could be thrown after an enemy)<br /><br />These weapons would have 7 properties which were avivable to get at a prop shrine if you had Black saphires etc.<br />which would include mp reg hp reg and some more which i dont recall.<br /><br />Just want somewhat a close dmg range on both classes so one of the classes wont out damage the other like hell unless the player has been smart, meaning we will have to be complex in how we place our stats thinking of speed on spells, hp, mana, and power.(which is why Xen was hardcore)<br /><br />Also Spirit Sword should be the same colour as the Spirits and should have some 3d animation of moving.<br />I will ask my Brother to paint up a 3D model of a spirit sword for me, he's a designer so it wont take very long before i send it to you karl.</div>

				<div class="content">I agree that the knight's damage is a little low at this point.  Whirlwind only deals 50% of the normal weapon damage, so it probably seems weak.  I'll try upping the amount for next update to see if that helps, as well as checking to make sure that str dmg bonus for knights and int dmg bonus for sorcerers are balanced.<br /><br />I'm very happy you're providing feedback--balancing classes is quite difficult since there are SO many variables.  Keep it coming <img src="images/smilies/icon_smile.gif" alt=":)" title="Smile" /></div>
