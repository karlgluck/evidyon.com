				<div class="content">I really don't get why people are getting so mad and crying about gear loss in this game at its current state. So i was at square just now, and superlong came and we pvped and he dropped me his bejewled ring.<br /><br />I have 6 already so i was going to trans over to him on square and drop it to him. Before i did he started saying &quot;little dog bum give it to me or you're being deleted, your choice&quot;.<br />I'm like dude, i was just about to drop it before you said that, now I'm not. He goes on saying hes going to get Karl to delete me because he set up the servers and Karl and Joe will do whatever he wants for him. And apparantly Joe drops him whatever gear he wants when hes logged on.<br /><br />He then took off all his gear and handed it to the person next to him. Saying &quot;Joe will give me more when he logs on&quot;.<br /><br />Heres just one screeny of the last thing he said before he went. I love how he said I'm a thief? I thought killing people and taking what they dropped was a HUGE part of this game.<br />And not considered thievery.<br /><br /><img src="http://i40.tinypic.com/w169fq.png" alt="Image" /></div>

				<div class="content">I knew you guys weren't like that, just from talking to you a few times.<br /><br />Thats what I'm saying, it doesn't really matter since gear is getting wiped, i don't understand why he made such a big deal about it.</div>

				<div class="content">LoL.. Stole??<br /><br />in Xenimus if somebody dropped anything above Ele Leather in the middle of square (Before G v E when 35+ people were always at square lol) 95% would be on it faster then you can say &quot;Wow&quot;..<br />It's not stealing if you remove it from your person. Although when you do, it's nothing but fair game.<br /><br />Although.. I did like it when somebody went to x1 and dropped some gear, and everybody would forget it's pvp server &quot;DERR&quot; and like a buncha people would go for it and a &quot;Not so good&quot; guy comes and kills everybody off sqr! (If they weren't quick enough to get back XD)  <img src="./images/smilies/icon_mrgreen.gif" alt=":mrgreen:" title="Mr. Green" /></div>
