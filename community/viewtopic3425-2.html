				<div class="content">I'm having a similar issue, As of this last update I can't even get into the logon screen.  Task Manager says there is an error message, but my screen is black until I shut down the Evidyon program.<br /><br />I did delete and re-install with no change in symptoms.<br /><br />I did adjust ForceSoftwareRendering to =1 with no change in symptoms<br /><br />I did notice that when I am on the update screen and I am downloading evidyon.evcli the download bar doesn't go further than 25 percent (and that is being generous in my description) before it becomes the play Evidyon button.<br /><br />I did notice that no matter how many times I've updated, if I run the launcher it will try to download Evidyon.evcli</div>
