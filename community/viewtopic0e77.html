			<div class="content">I don't like the ideas of making respecs easily available, even with absorbant costs, but new players might feel that they wasted the two weeks or so that they might take to get the basics down.  That is a lot of playtime.<br /><br />I theorize that it is relatively easy to get to 25, 30 with some hard work, with any build no matter how f-ed up the build is.  And the experience would give new players a hands-on chance to learn, even if they chose not to ask questions on the board.  I suggest that at level 25 or 30, a one time prompt shows up that gives the player an option to respec their stats.  They'd have to use it when the prompt arrives, or click cancel. <br /><br />I think this idea would let new players keep their original characters, without permitting older players to create level builds, then pvp builds in their 50's or 70's.</div>

			<div class="content">I'm talking about new players that haven't used a system like this before.  It takes time to learn how much of a mistake something is.  This suggestion is to give a one time advantage to make the game welcoming, at a level where it can't give an actually advantage over other players.  (The level choice was based on the notion of 100+ levels, not the current 35 cap)<br /><br />I personally have no problem with remaking characters, but I find it to be an enjoyable part of the game, one that wouldn't be damaged by my proposed system.<br /><br />Lexic, I think that system is neat, but I don't understand the basis.  Two character who have put equally as much effort into becoming strong should be able to carry the same weight, Two mages that have studied magic equally as much should deal the same arcane damage.  It should make no difference When or Where this studying or hard work was done.</div>

			<div class="content">This system was used in Xenimus when it came out for about 2 years or so and it was GREAT.  Some fighter types would sacrifice all their initial points at low level into Cons so that they would have massive hp at higher level, but this came with the consequence that you were slow and weak thus not leveling as fast.  <br /><br />I think a system like this should be put into Evidyon but have an effect on all stat points.  For example, two characters have the same amount of strength, but one character hits a little bit harder because he put into strength at lower levels.  <br /> <br />This will provide a challenege to determine when you want to put into each stat in addition to how many you want to put into each stat.  It will make one character different from another character, even though they have the same stats and everything else is the same.  One character who focused more on strength in the beginning will hit harder, while the other character who focused more on cons will have more hit points.<br /><br />As for understanding the basis of this, well I don't really know, but its a really cool idea to be able to truly make unique characters.   I guess you can thing of this as, for example, if one character has learned strength at a very early state, he can utilize it better because he has more experience with it.</div>

I think the lvl 25 OR 30 would allow you the chance to save your character at the point where it would become clear if you've made a big mistake.</div></blockquote><br /><br /><br />one freebie respec before you turn lvl 10 then, this way nobody will be able to go from suck to own, and every one is given a chance to fix their stupid specs.<br /><br />This should be backedup by a super stat system that made every single stat point count alot though.</div>

			<div class="content">Level 10 respec would be pointless. I got level 10 in like 1 hour. It should probably be like one freebie respec at 30. That's enough time to learn what your character is all about, how to play it and if you're good enough you caught some stats errors and here's your one chance to make it okay. I agree with if you put cons on early you should have more hp than someone with the same amount but decided to put their points in later. This goes for all stats too.</div>
