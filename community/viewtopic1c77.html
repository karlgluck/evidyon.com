				<div class="content">All you have to do is hold shift, press down the left-mouse button (in that order) and drag the mouse.  By the way--ALWAYS copy walls from the template.  When you do this, PV can &quot;optimize&quot; the walls when you draw them, by removing faces you can't see.</div>

<br />
<br />Yeah, highlighting the tile under the mouse, it isnt always easy to tell. 
<br />
<br />Scroll bar in the windows sense isnt necessary. but atleast some menu so we dont have to switch back and forth all the time.</div>

				<div class="content">couple more things:  
<br />the view-switch stopped working while I was in the middle of creating a map--I switched to top-down, and later, it wouldn't switch back.   
<br />(worked after I switched windows and switched back.  <img src="images/smilies/icon_confused.gif" alt=":?" title="Confused" /> who knows)
<br />
<br />Also, it would be helpful to have something, maybe in the corner, telling you what you have selected for terrain, model, etc.  
<br />
<br />When moving across the map, your cursor runs into the edge of the screen and you have to re-center to keep moving in the same direction.  Would it be possible to dis-associate the map-moving with the cursor in windows so there isn't that problem?
<br />
<br />And the zoom-out feature would be really, really useful.</div>

				<div class="content">you know that kinda thing where it places the models randomly all over? well you should make it so it does not place it over another object. i did that with trees and then there was like 2 trees in my house and all over other objects lol.
<br />
<br />Also should allow the selection of more then 1 items. this would be good for certain things. For instance you could set up premade things in the editor this way itd be easy . just go in select the entire house and set it. for instance like hold shift and drag to select more then 1 items. this would be a good feature and would make maps way easier.</div>

				<div class="content">also, since it's fair to assume that we won't be laying gigantic swords or wells around anywhere, would it be possible for models to initially appear at a default size, the one that makes sense?  Then maybe have the &quot;change size&quot; function attached to the '=/+' and '-/_' keys so that it doesn't happen by accident.  That would make the maps more usable--standardization is our friend, as Shi Huangdi of the Qin showed China...</div>

<br />_____________________
<br />
<br />Landscaping mode. the editor as is is more lent to crafting dungeons. We need a way to zoom way out and make large landforms more quickly. It would take absolutely forever to craft a landmass out of 200x200 squares. And you would have problems of the seperate peices not matching and fitting together and just an overall lack of cohesion. 
<br />
<br />I think the first thing we need to do is create a map of the world in MSPaint or something so we can get a general idea.</div>
