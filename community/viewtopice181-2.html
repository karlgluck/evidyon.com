				<div class="content">I'm not 100% sure if this is the case but I have heard that everyone will be wiped when it comes out. I understand the reasoning behind this but there could be a lot of good reasons not to do it as well.<br /><br />For example it would allow those of us who know the game pretty well to test new things being implemented before the general public gets to it. If we are all wiped when high lvl content/spells are added we could make sure its working as intended. This would give us an advantage at the start, but would also allow us to help the newer people out more easily right from the start (which was one of the downfalls of xen for new players). More than anything I'm curious as to what other people's opinions on this are. Would it be unfair or would it be beneficial to the game?</div>
