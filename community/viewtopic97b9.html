				<div class="content">Since you already have introduced several types of items like Crystalline, Azure, Bronze, Bejewled etc i wanted to suggest something.<br /><br />Dragons, there should be several types of dragons you could grind and they would all have different powers, bear with me <img src="images/smilies/icon_biggrin.gif" alt=":D" title="Very Happy" /><br /><br />Azure Dragons = Glacia ventus, Ignis Glacia (frost powers)<br />Crimson Dragons = Flama ventus, Ignis flamma (fire powers)<br />Emerald Dragons = Poison breath, and maybe poison cloud? (bug spray powers  <img src="images/smilies/icon_mrgreen.gif" alt=":mrgreen:" title="Mr. Green" /> )<br /><br />the thing is, people r grinding dragons alot easier than b4, and for beta they should be high risk and live in Caves not dungeons, unless enslaved, which is when the dragon would be called &quot;Troll/Adept/Wizard Enslaved Dragon&quot;<br /><br />The Azure Dragons could live in a Cave which had Blue Geocrystalls outside the cave and inside. <span style="font-size: 150%; line-height: 116%;"><span style="color: #004080">The frozen cave</span></span><br />The Red Dragons could live in some kind of lava pit along side with fire imps. <span style="font-size: 150%; line-height: 116%;"><span style="color: #FF0000">The Lava fields</span></span><br />The Emerald dragons could live in some area called <span style="color: #408000"><span style="font-size: 150%; line-height: 116%;">Enchanted Woods</span></span><br /><br />These would ofcourse be powerful beasts and should be somewhat away from areas where lowlevels would grind, maybe your first clearable spots?<br />to make these different dragons you would just Alter the Texture on dragons and how they behave with spells.<br /><br />You could also introduce a questline where you would have to kill 10 of each dragon, also they should not be obviously and easily found by any player, they would have 2 look for it.</div>

				<div class="content">Sounds like a good idea, but I think I'd rather have them as &quot;rare spawn&quot;. Like 1h spawn-time on each dragon, and that they drop rare loot (but not always)<br /><br />And that the quest is to kill 1 of each instead.</div>
