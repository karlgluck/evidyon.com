<br />Unfortunately, the game is in the state 9sam1 described.  The client can only walk around by itself, there are no monsters, and it can't connect to the internet.  All of this is under development.  When we have something to release, though, it will be done--trust me, I'm as excited as you are to release this thing!</div>
