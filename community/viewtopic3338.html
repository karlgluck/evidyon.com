				<div class="content">They've pointed out before that all the leveling speeds are recorded by the server.  Part of the beta is to find the right balance fore that too.  And when you are reporting bugs it is important not to exaggerate, nobody reached end-game in a week.  95% of the game isn't even released.<br /><br />That said, we don't know what the developers decided they wanted as average for a player.  At this rate it takes about a month to be level 35 (2 days to level 20, 1 week to level 30, 2 weeks to level 35, and this is assuming that you don't spend every waking moment on the game *stare at shup*) I'd guess it'd take about a year to a year to level 50 just because of exponential exp growth.  (assuming that there is no level cap anymore and appropriate leveling areas are released.)  That said, they might have planned updates up and to level 150, and fully intend for characters to be able to reach that goal in 6 years of dedicated playing.  (Last I heard, Xenimus players hadn't, or had barely broke 70)<br /><br />This is why I dig on everything you say on the boards.  It's not that you have specifically bad ideas.  It is that your posts are exaggerated, and read more like complaints than suggestions.  You don't have to know what the master plan is to post, but if your post is full of open ended questions or ideas, then it's easier for the Dev's to answer them without giving away their secrets (and still give away more than they intended too)</div>

				<div class="content">Marz, you would do well to listen to what Morn is saying.<br /><br />You should think of levels 1-35 as roughly equivalent to levels 1-20 in Xenimus.  Our endgame is planned beyond level 100; we WANT you to be high level because that's where the fun stuff is!<br /><br />Karl</div>

The hardcore beat all the content the game has to offer, and people complain that the end game was too easy. Just because 1-5% hit the end game, it doesn't mean end game was too easy. 95% are still trying to get there.</div>
