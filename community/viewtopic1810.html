				<div class="content">That sword (for it to be a high-level/high quality sword) need to be about <span style="text-decoration: underline">3-5 feet longer</span>, the skull have 2 heads facing opposite ways, and put <span style="text-decoration: underline">jewels in the eyes or on their forehead</span>, as well as <span style="text-decoration: underline">2-4 inches longer of a handle</span> (although that won't be seen when held, but only when on the ground), and make it so that the blade is made of the <span style="text-decoration: underline">Back Bone</span> of a creature as well. (I'm suspecting that the bone is from a very strong creature, maybe demon or something along the lines of Very Evil)</div>

Compared to other games, but in comparison theres not that many people playing xenimus.. (or that many high level characters..)<br /><br />But I'm sure everyone liked the looks of all the high level items in the game.. That's mainly cause there aren't like 100++ weapons in the game, so EJ had the time, and money to get/make weapons that looked awesome.</div>
