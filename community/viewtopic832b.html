				<div class="content">So I've been pounding away at the update all weekend, and it seems that this is going to be bigger than I thought.  To integrate the new combat system and spell system, even though they are designed, will involve a complete server overhaul.  This is both good and bad:  it will let me smooth out the game significantly, but at the same time, it is likely going to take until the end of Thanksgiving break to finish.  Well, enough talking--back to it <img src="images/smilies/icon_biggrin.gif" alt=":D" title="Very Happy" /></div>

				<div class="author">by <strong>Karl G.</strong></div>
				<div class="content">After coding my bum off since last Friday (I pretty much only slept ate and coded)...<br /><br />I haven't finished the update.  I'll explain why in a second--but what I did was definitely necessary.  I have been using a server architecture that, while fine for the simplistic roots on which Evidyon was built (adding a little each update) could not support heavy modification because it lacked consistent structure.  Each update added features into the existing form, or filled in and expanded when that structure wasn't adequate; however, the result was that when I tried to integrate a completely new magic system that was designed outside of the structure, there just wasn't anywhere that it would logically attach.  The modifications needed to support it ended up being so heavy that something else started to happen as I was working it in:  the server began to rewrite itself!<br /><br />I use that phrasing intentionally--I didn't plan on rewriting the server with this update, just tearing out and replacing the combat and magic code.  What I found, however, was that as I found places to link the new magic system, there was an immediate need to reform those places.  As those changes were made, they spread to more of the code.<br /><br />What I've ended up with is a completely new server.  It is much more scalable, extensible, modular and it will be *far* easier to integrate new components, such as the upcoming Geosids and item-spells.  In fact, it's so much better that I ran into a problem that I've never had before:  the main server loop runs so ridiculously fast that, before I slowed it down, the speed caused movement bugs due to the limited precision of the variables (!!!) that store character positions.<br /><br /><br />So where do we stand?  Right now, avatar movement--even for fast characters on slow client connections--is almost rock solid.  Jumping around and jittering is nearly unnoticeable.  With this foundation, I am about to integrate the new magic system and set up some basic spells for it.  I have done away with the idea that you can abstract away or template every aspect of the spells, and have made it much easier to hand-code some of the more interesting behaviors that would not have been possible in the old system.  It can currently handle everything from enchantments that change how your items look to projectiles that split after having traveled a certain distance, and VFV to poison clouds.<br /><br />I have also set up the code to handle character groups and included it in the magic code.  The party system is integrated in the magic controller, so not only are parties pretty much ready to go but doors are open for cool stuff like buffing spells that affect your whole nearby party, and damage spells that will only hit enemies.<br /><br />That said, I'm working on spell visualizations at this point.  Since this magic system is so different, I have to retool the part of the game editor that configures them and all of the spells will have to be redone.  Come to think of it...this is going to be a whopper of an update.<br /><br /><br /><br />Anyway, after all that I'd like to offer a glimpse of the future.  My plan is to release this next update plus one more (to be determined, ETA start of January), then go bananas with content (items, spells, monsters, world design, etc).  At the end of January, Evidyon will be launched on a commercial server and will open for public beta testing.</div>

				<div class="content">Also, Karl, before you release any sort of Beta version, there's plenty of hacks that still exist in the game(like, for example, transing onto any coordinate on the map <img src="images/smilies/icon_smile.gif" alt=":)" title="Smile" />, althought I haven't tested this one lately... maybe you fixed it) and stat point hacks...

Now that I have a better idea of what is required of a magic system, I have implemented it in such a way that these checks are really easy to do, and don't require ugly hacks.  I expect the next update to be far more secure.<br /><br />As far as the character creation stat points, what did I miss out on?  I thought I had tested that pretty thoroughly.<br /><br /><br />Also, a quick status report:<br />I have actually tested the magic system for the first time (with a real spell &amp; spell effects!)  It works perfectly!<br />The spell I implemented was a &quot;group teleport&quot;.  It won't actually be implemented in the real game right now, but it was straightforward to test.  It allows you to take members of your group that are near by with you when you teleport.  Might be kinda nifty as a rescue tool, come to think of it.<br /><br />Anyway, it's my girlfriend's 21st birthday today so I'm taking the rest of the day off <img src="images/smilies/icon_biggrin.gif" alt=":D" title="Very Happy" /></div>

I would be interested in knowing what EJ did.<br /><br />The system I have implemented is rather straightforward with no real optimizing tricks.  At the moment, each update packet is ~24 bytes of data+overhead.  Update packets are generated differently depending on how your character is moving.  Movement from A to B, for example, generates exactly 2 packets.  Continuously changing your direction while running generates one packet every 300 milliseconds.</div>
