				<div class="content">Well, we've got guilds, we've sort of got sets of gear, and several classes, now the next level would be mixxing all of those together?<br />This will help enhance the idea of exclusive guilds, because nobody wants some newb stealing all the best drops from a boss, and people will pretty much be getting friendly and want no outsiders screwing with them.<br /><br />For players to create their own exclusive guilds, there must be some &quot;non-exclusive&quot; guilds aswell.<br />Guilds should not have a maximum number of players, if some moron(pardon my french) decides to invite 200 people into 1 guild, then he will be screwing himself over by the end of the day. and this is why:<br /><br />Raid dungeon:<br />There are dungeons where players with high skill may enter with their comrades to seek ancient treasures(rare items.<br />A raid Dungeon would consist of high level monsters &amp; bosses whom hit harder than usual and endure more damage, but also drop better than usual, there are however several sets of drops, one which benefits each class, so you will have to wait until your set item drops by clearing the dungeon several times.<br />There is room for 16 players within a raid dungeon. <br />A raid would be like starting a guild-sized party otherwise known as Raid ingame, a player would have to join another leading him to a raid, possible indication r/lead &lt;Bob is inviting players to raid&gt; to join then r/join<br /><br />Party dungeon: basically the same as a raid dungeon only on a smaller scale, 8 players, monsters hit harder than normal monsters and endure more damage but they drop uncommon items.<br /><br /><br />So by the end of the day, the game is about getting gear and cool stuff, so people will actually make their guild more exclusive so they can get their gear faster, and this will probably make people apply to guilds formally.</div>

				<div class="content">Raid dungeons and guaranteed better drops violate several of the Pre-Concepts of the game.  <br /><br />1- You can get pk'd/PVP ANYWHERE that is not a safe zone.  IE- There are NO special maps where you are going to only enu counter members of your own party.<br />If you want better drops, and have the benefit of a guild that is helpful, you can always get a bunch of friends together and explore an area 5-10 levels higher than your own.  The group of you could help defend against any higher lvls that decide to pk you.<br /><br />2- Non-Tiered Gear is supposed RARE.  As in you could probably trade one piece of Rare gear for a whole stack of lightning rings.

				<div class="content">I'm not to sure if I like the Idea of guilds getting better gear drops through monsters. This would kind of make it necessary for players to join a guild to stay competitive. I think alot of people like going lone wolf, I know I do sometimes.<br /> No body likes some noob stealing the drops BUT whats the fun in denying that &quot;noob&quot; the opportunity? let the games developing social politics decide what happens to the gear hogging assholes in parties. I know sometimes when I go hard linches with people it is a ninja fest but it's all in competitive fun and no body is particularly caring atm because we all seem to have a neutral respect WHICH however will change as time goes on. A well organized guild will sort out what happens to dropped gear and most likely divide it based on members need. I know when me and Zor go hunting we come back to town split anything we have doubles of and give anything that the over class needs. It is a crucial part of game survival finding people you can trust. I think something like this should go into one of those games you don't particularly have to think about. I will fall in love with this game if social dynamics/ politics and player intelligence is a vital part of gameplay. Although I completely understand alot of people are simply not interested in this stuff.</div>
