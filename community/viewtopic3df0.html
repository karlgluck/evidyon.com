				<h3>UPDATE: Server Up This Weekend</h3>
				<div class="date"><img src="styles/prosilver/imageset/icon_post_target.gif" width="11" height="9" alt="Post" title="Post" />Posted: <strong>Thu Nov 12, 2009 1:20 pm</strong></div>

				<div class="content">Karl's server subscription will end on the 24rth of this month.  <br />Today, he set up the Evidyon server on a laptop he has stationed at my house.<br />I have played on the server and have casted many spells (the ones that tend to cause lag) and have not had any bad or major lags.<br />I did however, have a few frames that lagged.  That lag occured when I key spammed Orbis Flamma.  That spell usually causes some lag anyways.<br />The lag on this server is a lot less and was hardly noticeable, i had to do it a few times to make sure it was lagging at all.  <br /><br />The full server transfer will take place this weekend.  Karl will get the player account files transfered over to the computer at my house, then everything should be normal.  Also, we will see if any lag takes place when other players are online.<br /><br />This will save Karl a lot of money by not having to pay server fees.  Money that would be better off going into things like items and armor packs.</div>

				<div class="content">I have worked 2 1/2 hours today on modifying the current map.  I added 2 new monsters and 2 new level spawn areas.<br />Props go out to Karl, Erich, and Joe!<br />Man, editing this map is simple but very excrutiating.  There are like 9 layers needed just to create the one map.<br />There is just so much you got to remember to save, and it all has to be saved in it's own individual file.<br /><br />I will talk to Karl about the release of Ryan's mod (the map I am making now) and see when I can get it uploaded.</div>

				<div class="content">Thanks for the hard work. I'm assuming it's because you're working on moving the server/updating as mentioned above, but I figure I should mention that the server is down atm. <img src="images/smilies/icon_smile.gif" alt=":)" title="Smile" /></div>

Karl won't have time till tomorrow morning to transfer the player files to the laptop.<br />So if you wanted to, you could make a new account if you want to play that bad.<br />The laptop now doesnot have the player files, so there are no accounts on it.<br /><br />The Config file within Evidyon's program file folder needs to have this at the bottom.<br />INSTEAD OF<br />[Network]<br />Server1=66.96.229.53<br /><br />NEEDS TO BE,<br />[Network]<br />Server1=evidyon.no-ip.org</div>

				<div class="content">SWEETNESS!  The files have just been transfered, Thank you Karl, and we are good to go.<br /><br />For Stick Stickly and Mibudin, sorry guys but we couldn't keep the new server files, so you will have t ostick to your old builds.  <br /><br />For next release hopefully in a week,<br />-There will be a stat reset.<br />-Level cap increase will be set pretty high.<br />-Also, a full map release is highly possible.</div>
