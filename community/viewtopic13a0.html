				<div class="content">Well i was stacking my items differently on my character &quot;carnage&quot; and noticed by stacking it in different ways i would get more than 200 hp pluss or is this 200 hp i was missing? <img src="images/smilies/icon_smile.gif" alt=":)" title="Smile" /> <br /><br />now i have 2103 hp and 355 defence, by stacking it differently i can get 2020 hp 2063 hp 1998 hp.<br />i stacked them and made a list about how i could stack for highest amount hp gain.<br /><br />Spirit dragon axe<br />Aurelian platemail<br />Argent belt<br />Devine aegis<br />Aurelian gloves<br />6 bjs<br />Helm of spite<br /><br />This is my recipe for 2103 hp, put your items the same way and see if you get the same results, i stacked mine after their abilities though.<br /><br />and i now found the only reason im 26 is because helm of spite gives me an ability level <img src="images/smilies/icon_smile.gif" alt=":)" title="Smile" /></div>

				<div class="content">This is in the issues list, though I'm not sure that it's something that Karl wants to fix.  The problem is that all of the %HP/MP items give you a % bonus based on your <span style="font-style: italic">modified</span> HP/MP, not your base.  So if you have, say 100 HP, an item (A) that gives you +50 HP, and an item (B) that gives you +10% HP, if you stack (A) then (B) you'll have 165 HP, but if you stack (B) then (A), you'll have 160 HP.<br /><br />With the Bejewled Rings, this can make quite a difference.<br /><br /><span style="font-style: italic">I should note--I haven't tested this in a while:  it could have been fixed without me noticing.</span></div>

				<div class="content">My brother and I have been discussing this.  Personally, I like that an item's effects are compounded.  Let's say you have two kinds of rings: one kind that gives +% HP and another that gives +% speed.  If you have 5 +%HP rings, the 6th % hp ring is worth a LOT more than the first; similarly, a sixth+%speed ring is worth more than the first 5--and mixing/matching rings may let you spread out a bit, but you won't get half the benefit with half the rings.  You'll get less than half, so it encourages characters to go all-out.<br /><br />However, the problem that Joe mentioned is not easily solved without sorting your inventory every time your avatar's equipment changes.  I guess I'll just make it do % of base values then and not compound...</div>

				<div class="content">Ok, I'll keep items stacking.  I just got the impression that it generally wasn't appealing, but if that's not the case then I'm glad it's staying <img src="images/smilies/icon_smile.gif" alt=":)" title="Smile" /></div>

				<div class="content">I also like the idea of having different stacks, because 1 might add more hp, but antoher stack will help your def it's a balance of what u want with the same gear.   It'd be nice as a new player to know about this.... i went from 360 hp to like 562 or so which was a huge jump for a mage.   Although I love my hp now in comparison.</div>
