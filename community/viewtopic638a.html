Its damage is calculated like a melee attack though.<br /><br /><blockquote><div><cite>marzuku wrote:</cite>When can we reset stats?</div></blockquote><br />I'll reset when I do the next major balancing update.<br /><br /><blockquote><div><cite>marzuku wrote:</cite>could you make the delay of vortex for knights lower so they dont move 2 feet an hour?</div></blockquote><br />Yeah, that delay was added in to make it work like whirlwind--for some reason, they have exactly the same stats but vortex cancels itself but whirlwind doesn't.  Haven't figured that one out yet.<br /><br /><blockquote><div><cite>marzuku wrote:</cite>Lower the damage of Caster beam and Vortex so they are almost similar so that people actually will have use of heals in battle?</div></blockquote><br />Balancing, balancing.  It's in progress.<br /><br /><br />Thanks for the comments!~</div>
