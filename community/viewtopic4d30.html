				<div class="content">Strength = Determines how hard you hit with melee or ranged attacks, not confirmed but I think it increases HP just a bit.<br />Agility = Determines how fast your will hit with melee, ranged, and how fast you can cast spells.<br />Constitution = Increase the amount of HP the player has.<br />Intelligence = Increase the amount of MP the player has as well as increasing spell damage.<br />Wisdom = Has been described in other posts, I will try my best at this one. Increase MP ever slightly as well as increase the buff duration of your spells and I think possibly increases spell damage, but I am unsure about that this.<br /><br />I hope that helps and do correct me if I am wrong, especially on Wisdom.</div>

				<div class="content">Allright..<br /><br />So what you're saying is that Intel increases MP and Spelldmg, and Wisdom slightly increases MP and maybe spelldmg.<br />Buff duration is not really usefull seeing as it takes a fraction of a second to rebuff. Makes it look like wisdom is currently a useless stat tbh.<br /><br />Or is it like xen, where certain classes uses intel as dmg stat, and other wisdom ?<br />Like Wiz / warlock use intel for dmg, and clerics / druids use wisdom for dmg .<br /><br />This needs to get explained. Otherwise it's hard to make a good spellcaster atm.</div>
