				<div class="content">Removing unlimited transport and adding some defense to casters the solution?<br /><br />Melee can trans as much as a caster and catch up to them, which is why melee wins the battle.<br /><br />Melee arent supoused to be able to rely on trans but more on run attack to catch up.<br /><br />Tele should cost more and knights should have less mp so they couldnt rely on trans before higher levels.<br />as i recall also fighters had trans wands did they not on xen? they didnt even have transport <img src="./images/smilies/icon_mrgreen.gif" alt=":mrgreen:" title="Mr. Green" />  which was why they used run attack.</div>
