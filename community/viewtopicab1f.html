				<div class="content">Are valtus charms supposed to fail randomly? It failed again today on me, it's about the 3rd or 4th time. I have a suspicion that the game chooses the Valtus charm to drop and so negates its purpose. Today's instance: I was at trolls and I noticed something about the layout in the cave, and attempted to trans into a wall. It showed my character still against the wall, but something was now hitting me, and my healing spells, which WERE casting, had no effect. I also could not move after attempting to trans into the wall.</div>

				<div class="content">I have noticed that you do drop them. <br />This is why i have at least 3 of them on me at one time, you can have 6 rings on total.<br />That way if one does drop I have spares equipped.<br /><br />Also, if you die, all your inventory is dropped and if you choose to respawn, the other rings that you have equipped will go to your inventory.  So if you choose to standup, then you will need to re-equipe them pretty quickly then pick up your gear.</div>
