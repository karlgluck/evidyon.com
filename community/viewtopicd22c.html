				<div class="content">Well, since i kinda asked publicly i found out that the majority of the players on Evidyon have not played Xen and if they did they played x2, meaning that they probably dont have the urge to kill any one.<br /><br />Guys, PvP wont develop if we dont fight eachother and test it out guys, on alpha all we did was pvp when we were at SQ and it was freaking fun, so im suggesting this to my fellow players, test out pvp and report certain balance issues between classes.<br /><br /><br />BTW, the balance scale between damage and gear/stats is kinda weak, a good player should be able to kill another player at same lvl at 3-4 hits instead of like 8 when obviously they will be able to heal when it takes so much time, i kinda liked the geosid healing from Alpha btw, we already got geosids.<br />Maybe make player vs player based protection less potent?<br /><br />Stun/stupify:<br />Warriors are melee characters so they kinda need to be up close to a target when it comes to killing it, a caster though would most likely trans like a tranny when it came to pvp, suggesting some spells that pin down targets for x amount of time, both classes could have one.<br />also maybe a stupify pot that puts some liquid poison on your wepon making the enemies attack slower by x %?<br /><br />Spell removal:<br />Dispell, we need a disp because some players enjoy buffing eachother before going into battle, and when the enemy player hits faster than muhammed ali you are seeing butterflies and being stung by giant bee's.</div>

				<div class="content">Hey the lack of a trans spell for warriors makes up for the low survivability of casters.  Right now someone like say Shupter can kill me in 1-2 hits because I have like 500 or so hp, and don't give me &quot;more cons less int&quot; crap because if defense is factoring into my spell damage then Shupter would be very difficult to defeat with his 900+ hp and he would still have the upper hand.  Besides, warriors can still get dozens upon dozens of trans wands from geosids - problem solved.<br /><br />There's so much factoring into PvP which is why more testing is needed to determine if all of these statements are really true.</div>

You, and those that argue against you, have a different idea of what &quot;fair&quot; is. Xenimus is not the only qualification for knowing what makes PvP fair and fun. If more people (or the developers) think the game is more fun one way, then it will go that way. If you don't like it, deal with it or leave. Second, this is not some pro-Xenimus-player exclusive game. It is BASED off of it, but may go in totally new directions based on different opinions, mostly the developer's opinions.(deja vus) Judging from the (actually more than 2) people that disagree with you, I think it will go in different directions. I'm not trying to say that you should stop posting, that would be rediculous. It does seem though that you have moved away from putting valid/plausible points out, and on to attacking (the... gaming credentials..? [lol?] of) other people. <br /><br />Before anyone keeps complaining about PvP, I think we need to pay attention to the notifications of a PvP arena that will significantly help in the ballancing. Complaining right now with no evidence to back it up, and no developers with much free time to look into it, will not change much (if anything).</div>

				<div class="content">No PvP aspects is a little exaggerated. My point is that most games do have them, you simply don't recognize them because you don't like the style. I wanted to point out they they are valid too, and may be seriously considered.<br /><br />Edit: Just a thought but, it's almost impossible to not get into a little PvP in Xenimus.  Even on the PvE servers people are allowed 1 free pk a day, and if someone starts a fight, you can pk again. Maybe people didn't play on the PvP servers because they didn't like the style, just as you don't like the style they are suggesting. If they didn't play Xenimus, I still think they would have played another MMORPG with pvp aspects (EVEN IF THEY ARE DIFFERENT, they are still there). Have you asked them that? Not enjoying your style of gameplay doesn't invalidate their opinions.</div>
