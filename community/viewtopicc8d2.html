				<div class="content">Oh maybe that's why we can't find the secret places because transing while falling hasn't been working in a long time. I just thought it was something we couldn't do in this game and was meant for nimbus. I wasn't thinking very clearly or I would have posted a long time ago, since this game is going to better than Xenimus(almost there in beta lmao) of course it's meant to work lol.</div>

				<div class="content">Okay <br />1. Shard Guards don't fend off monsters.<br />2. The monsters called &quot;Spirits&quot; do way too much damage with their beams. You can't live through 2 of them.<br />3. The monsters that do the burn spell should have their casting speed lowered.. if theirs more than 2 they can be very deadly.<br />4. Mage classes have a tough time living in this new update.<br />5. Bows on hunters don't do damage or little to none with their multi.</div>

				<div class="content">Must bring this to attention once again.. <span style="font-weight: bold">ALL</span> spell casting monsters are way over-powered. You pretty much can't explore anything now. I did see a new area.. keyword &quot;see&quot; you die in coming range of it because of Spirits and Malorman Spirits.<br /><br />Update on Shards: You can take a shard up to 24% bonus and once you try to take it once more your guild doesn't own it anymore and you have to log off and take it again to own it. If you stay at 24% bonus and take another shard you can get that other shard to 9% and then anymore than that and you lose that shard and have to repeat what I said earlier. Upon logging off and logging back on any shards you have built up to 24% or lower will revert back to 4%.</div>

				<div class="content">Right, some quick responses:<br /><br />Malmoran Spirits (and the spirits nearby) are overpowered because that area is marked level 20-25 =)<br /><br />I agree the monsters that burn are a bit tough.  I was just happy they worked at all =p<br /><br />Hunter bows still need to be balanced.<br /><br /><br /><br />Shards:  you're only supposed to be able to take a geosid *one* time, not multiple times!  That's why there are several of them...thanks for the heads-up.</div>

				<div class="content">lmao about the shards.. makes sense because you said there would be more later on. Yea I was just getting a little frustrated last time I played because the game play was really tough because of the casting monsters. That's cool there's a level 25 section even though the cap is 15... anytime it'll be lifted for that area? <img src="images/smilies/icon_biggrin.gif" alt=":D" title="Very Happy" /></div>

				<div class="content">ok so did he let you guys know how it was letting you take the geosid repetitively? and yeah they need a little work. <br />another thing is that once u get lvl 15 and ur preanlty exp just keeps getting higher and higher because there is nothing you can do to make it go down<br />also i found a longbow but it doesnt seen to be implemented as a bow yet</div>

				<div class="content">if you remember from XEN karl adepts etc would not always beam you they would actually beam you once or twice then start flamma or hit you, i suggest the burning monsters apear less frequently and have a limit to how many times they can cast the spell, this way its up to chance wether you die of one.<br /><br />suggesting this because a instant spell always has to be balanced, and that because if you start of with hardcore monsters and always have to top them we will have insanely crazy monsters on our tails to fast.</div>

				<div class="content">I don't know if it's because it's like a &quot;minor&quot; spell at the moment.. but the beam spell should do more damage than the multi spells since it's a concentrated spell.</div>

				<div class="content">Well i don't know if these are declared yet or not...<br />1. Port Shards work now.. but all of them send you to the Blue Shard.<br />2. Bottom left Nexus Shard(Port shard) will do have you do a spin attack on right click.<br />3. Bottom right Nexus Shard will let you trans around in the circle on right click.. nothing too special.(top shard works good)<br />4. The green/yellow particle transers don't work anymore.<br />5. Beaming and transing around isn't very smooth.</div>
