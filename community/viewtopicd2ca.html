				<div class="content">I was thinking about the debate about GvC, and this is what I understand of the system so far.<br /><br />Good=Existence<br /><br />The only thing you get rewarded for is creating an account.  Your characters automatically gain good points and you get more good points if you log in.  Ergo the anti-thesis Chaos<br /><br />Chaos=Corrosive<br /><br />Where ever the chaos is, we cannot go.  the black barrier around explorable land just does not exist.  Therefore in order to become chaotic you must not only kill other players, but do so to the extent of <span style="font-weight: bold">preventing them from playing the game.</span>  Being a player kill 3 or 4 times a day (or even 10 times if you haven't killed in a while) doesn't make you chaotic.<br /><br /><span style="font-weight: bold">Good Players</span> are rewarded by not dropping gear as often when they die.  Then can be justified because there is a NEXUS, and it appears that existence is in the NEXUS's best interest, and therefore it would reward those who encourage existance<br /><br /><span style="font-weight: bold">Chaotic Players</span> are rewarded with <span style="font-style: italic">freedom</span> to <span style="font-style: italic">take</span> whatever is within their power to take.  Be it a hunting area, gear, a player's stock of potions and charms, etc.<br /><br />I currently love this system, but I can see how someone who truly desired to be a chaotic player full up would eventually find it impossible to play the game.  I don't think the path should be encouraged but I do realize that it takes away from concept of being able to choose your path.  Here are some ideas that might be compatible with the system if my above assumptions are correct.<br /><br /> <img src="images/smilies/icon_question.gif" alt=":?:" title="Question" /> As the Nexus pushes back the chaos, there could be areas of weakened chaos that do massive damage to Heroic Players and would do incrementally less up to barely damaging as much as a character regenerates, based on alignment.  (It could never be dmg free because you Exist)  These are areas where chaotic players could escape and delude themselves into thinking they are unpunished, and feel that they are not dependant on the NEXUS, and this would leave the majority of the game favoring Good players.<br /><br />Since the area would always move after map expansions, Chaotic players would have to live a versatile life on the run.  It would also give good players breaks from chaotic influences.  (If the weakened chaos carried a decent leveling area, chaotic players would spend a lot of time hunting with only having to worry about other chaotic players, and not have to worry about heroic ones.) and also give periods where Chaotic players can do nothing but take over areas of free land (when the weakened areas contain nothing but landscape or an unoccupied city)  I don't think this would cause an imbalance because it would be a small part of the map most of the time.  And sometimes it can contain monsters of such high level that Chaotic players can't even use it.</div>

				<div class="content">You are forgetting the nice thing: Bounty hunters. <br /><br />Bounty hunters: as a good player you are allowed to bounty hunt Chatoic players, and by how much the chaotic player has caused death and decay you recieve from the guards a bounty hunter reward.<br /><br />Would work: Chaotic players would drop Bounty Hunter Charms 1 every day, which then could be traded for gold/random rare item/pots?<br /><br />Also: to find out who was the Most evil, and who you should hunt to gain the most, there should be Top Chaotic player list, and Top Good player list, where the 10 most evil and good players are shown.</div>

				<div class="content">I don't like the bounty hunter idea.  Namely because it doesn't fit anywhere else in the system.  wth should I give a poo about a charm that gives me a random item, I'm killing you because of the gear you're wearing is something I might like.  There is no way for me to tell if your a chaotic player right now (unless I'm standing by a guard) so it's still High Risk High Reward.<br /><br />In fact, the bounty system gives people encouragement to become evil so that they can make sure the first person to kill them is someone they want to have their bounty charm.  they can just log on and let their friends kill them for charms and then spend the rest of the day pking.</div>
