				<div class="content">Haha uh...weird!<br /><br />I think a lot of these problems have to do with how the GUI is set up in code.  Although the GUI core component system is fabulously designed (at the risk of sounding a bit conceited) the system that wraps around it to create a whole menu is something of an abomination.  Here's a brief explanation:<br /><br />The inventory re-sorts when you log out because the ordering of the inventory is entirely managed by your client, and it doesn't save inventory order between sessions.<br /><br />Whenever you click an item to move it from your inventory to equipped (or the reverse), the system marks it as &quot;changed&quot;.  &quot;Changed&quot; items are sorted to the end of the list.  In this way, if you click repeatedly in your inventory it will just cycle through all of the items in your inventory and try to equip them.  This serves a dual purpose:  (1) it makes new items show up at the end of the list, and (2) it prevents you from accidentally clicking an item twice.  Because there is server lag and your inventory isn't updated until the server says it's OK (the client has no notion of what is &quot;allowed&quot; to be equipped), if this didn't happen then you could easily click an item twice and it would equip, then unequip due to this lag.  It's very annoying, so I fixed it using this method.  That's probably more than you wanted to know.<br /><br />FPS counter:  yes it's implemented (FPS is dynamically adjusted) but it isn't displayed.  Why do you want one?<br /><br />The system keys should be fixed as of the latest update--have you downloaded it using the launcher?</div>

				<div class="content">Thanks for the explanation.  Makes sense.  There's still the question of the Shrubbery being unequipped.<br /><br />I would like to see an FPS counter so that I know how changing resolutions, doing a lot of stuff simultaneously, &amp;c. affects how the game runs.  For example, when I set the game to a higher resolution, I notice some difference, but I can't quantify it.<br /><br />I have the latest update, but it isn't helping my system key problem:  every time I log out they reset.</div>

				<div class="content">A strange bug that I experienced a while back.  I figured it was an anomaly or was ironed out with updates, but yesterday I was talking to Doc Holliday in-game and he described the same thing:<br /><br />For no apparent reason, my character suddenly became super-fast. We're talking skittering across the screen faster than the fastest gas. This lasted for a while and made hunting very easy, but then ceased--I can't recall whether it was log-off or death that ended it for me, but for Doc it was log-off.</div>

				<div class="content">A different layout would be good.  Right now the big irritation is flipping between screens:  after listing an item, you can't tell whether it actually made it to the listing or not unless you flip to the &quot;view sales&quot; list.<br /><br />Other things:<br />*  When you click an item to list, have the price box ready to type, so that a player doesn't have to click it with the mouse first.  The price entry screen could take the righthand box, while leaving the lefthand one to your listed sales.<br /><br />*  Page, don't scroll, through item lists.<br /><br />Layout:</div>
