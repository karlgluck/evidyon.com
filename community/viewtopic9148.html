				<div class="content">Yeah... it's really just connecting both things to the same database. But it's not exactly quite <span style="font-style: italic">that</span> easy... Depends on how the message board handles accounts/database, and whether it can be modified to suit different database needs. I've never made a message board so I can't really comment too much on this...  <img src="images/smilies/icon_neutral.gif" alt=":|" title="Neutral" /></div>

				<div class="content">While it did have some funny things, FFA also had more than its share of piles o' bullcrap. We would rather create a gamer community that is a bit more welcome to new players than those that abuse the lack of rules and rant in the...&quot;<span style="font-style: italic">MENSA</span> Tales&quot;... FFA forum. In reply to stickly: FFA is a casual topic forum with NO RULES, which means all sorts of flaming, personal attacks, and inappropriate content can be posted. Casual would still have the normal rules prohibiting that. You could say it is a watered down FFA, yes.</div>

				<div class="content">The guild thing is a good idea. As for FFA a new player, if not stupid, would know that that forum has nothing to do with the game, and it's just a place for players to bs while not on the game. Hence free for all. Description could be something a long the lines of &quot;a place for any/many topics not related to the <br />game can be shared.  No racism/sexism or any other types of insults will be tolerated and this forum will be heavily moderated.&quot;</div>
