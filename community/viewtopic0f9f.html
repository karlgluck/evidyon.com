				<div class="content">Hey, i have been crashing often and when i log back in my screen is black and im in the middle<br />of nothing wit an exp debt. (regardless of if i have LSA's on) I have leveled 4 times with an outstanding<br />exp debt and because i crash a lot it has been sitting at 90k... can you pllleease do something <br />about my debt? <br /><br />also, transing in cliffs (to get to geos) and leaping for my char is bugged and i lose exp as well.<br />(so if im the only one on and im outa LSA's/ports/ w/e im outa luck)<br /><br />other ideas: <br />i noticed the Holy Kuriks were a low item? they should be fast! ( they look all kinds of quick)<br /> <br />exploding arrows?<br /><br />more rings?<br /><br />thanks!<br />Swift</div>

				<div class="content">Black Screen Should be fixed now so You don't lose exp during crashes.<br /><br />Exp debt only halves your exp gain (half goes to debt, half goes to level) so it will go away over time, and I think it will be likely that exp debt will be wiped in the near future after crashes are fixed.<br /><br />More info on what happens when you trans and leap, and is this recent because both of those have been recently fixed.<br /><br />Karl fixed many items, check them again.<br /><br />I have a feeling that non-tiered rings (tiered items are the common, when you are hunting you should find a lot of low level, some approximate level, and a few great items that can fit into the leather&lt;iron&lt;fire&lt;earth&lt;holy&lt;etc system) are rare items.  It has been said that rare items are EXTREMELY rare.  Since each item outside of the tiered system would be likely to give a unique type of advantage, someone (I believe Joe) said that you are more likely to find 3000 tiered rings (the rarest tiered item) before you find a Rare item.</div>

				<div class="content">Today (10-19) I have begun lagging really bad and then crashing a few seconds later for no particular reason. I am a Sorcerer. I think it might have something to do with lumos nex because I just started mas spamming it today when I hunt.  Up until this point I used the spinning flame spell on a constant basis.</div>

				<div class="content">The problem occurred when you took off then put on armor, moved around and repeatedly cast a self-targeted spell (se mederi, for example).  I was copying things in a way that was unusual, but should have worked....but it ended up not working.</div>
