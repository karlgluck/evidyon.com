				<div class="content">I'm sure it's mentioned, but after dieng and not moving, my character moves from standing to lying down in one swift rocking motion almost like a pendulum, and it doesn't stop until I click....very trippy but un -intentional I'm sure. uhh. oh yeah, I have a perfect example of how your character altering went. <br /><br />    I have a level 9 genii adept (which reminds me, stats screen doesn't show your class.) This character was created in 1.09 or 1.08 I think. back when you were still accepting alpha testers. so here might be some info on how your adjustments affected this particular character since then;<br /><br />it's stats are (were)<br />                                            |My paladin|don't know old hp/mp<br />Level: 9                         |level 15 -                |<br />                                      494hp/56mp            |<br />(232)/122 hp                 |30str, 17agi,  22cons,  10wis,  10int  |<br />(242)/154 mp                 <br /><br />str  agi   cons   wis   int<br />13   10    18      23     15<br /><br />...........the running non stop thing still happens too which is annoying <img src="images/smilies/icon_smile.gif" alt=":)" title="Smile" /> hmm...auto attack is nice...game is too easy to exit, can be a problem... the letter&quot;A&quot; on a keyboard makes you repeat last chat line, which makes you a spammer. there were 2 people on, and both kept making this mistake constantly, including myself. shields don't drop from monsters. no lsas or bags.<br /><br />I also think the speed and strength of heal spells (and maybe all elements) be based on character level and or healing power.<br />respawn command will be used/abused frequently. (maybe remove or add a 1 hour wait to it when released)<br />you can now wear a chest-piece of armor on your arm as a shield(forgot which item)<br />I have to go to sleeeeeeeeeeeeep argh, I tried. later.<br /><br />-prehizzle</div>

				<div class="content">Hey prehistoric,<br /><br />Thanks for your input!  I've read over it and have the following comments:<br /><br />- With the current magic system, it is very difficult to have spells increase in power with higher level.  This is fixed with the new system <img src="images/smilies/icon_smile.gif" alt=":)" title="Smile" /><br />- I am planning on completely revamping the stat screen with the next update (but please remind me if I forget!).  If you have an idea for how it should look &amp; what it should include, feel free to draw something up in Paint and show me.<br />- running non-stop is fixed with next update<br />- auto attack will be improved<br />- I saw your messages in the server's text log <img src="images/smilies/icon_razz.gif" alt=":P" title="Razz" /> 100 lines of &quot;&quot; lol.  The say-again key can be configured in the settings dialog.<br />- I know about the armor-as-shield bug (thanks tho)<br />- Respawn command will be removed for Beta--it's just for testing during alpha.</div>

				<div class="content">1.) did you read all those lines where I was talking to you, assuming youd read the logs? lol....kinda cool.<br /><br />2.) here's the idea I had for the spells.... I was looking into formulae like this... (5+self.int/50+self.wis/25) or (5+(200/50+100/25)) = 13 if you based shield spells off of this, it would gradually increase like I was saying, you can also base those formulae on the elemental powers of the caster...or all....but I hope that gives a general idea of my concept.  that way, if you were god with 50,000 wis, you could cast a protect spell on us and we would get un godly aweesome boostage. whereas, the same spell casted by a mortal, would get balanced benefits. this would also enable the players to focus more into certain types. <br /><br />sorry forthe inability to elaborate, I just got back from the bar im staying at a hotel partieng in the city with family for turkey day.  burrrrp. it's good to know youre way ahead of me on those other subjects... once again.....great work karl. <br /><br />-always playing/testing/learning/watching/pking<br /><br />-prehistoric</div>
