				<h3>Map Idea: Capital City</h3>

				<div class="content">Concept behind this:
<br />Cities should be race-based. A scallion city, an elf city, a human city, a gnome city, and a dreg city. Each of it's guards would use the skills of the default class of that race (ex: Dreg-fighter, Elf- Ranger, Human- Anything, Scallion- Wizards and Warlocks, Gnome- Clerics
<br />
<br />Capital city can follow two paths, which needs to be decided upon. 
<br />1.) A ruling race. 
<br />2.) A cultural mix
<br />
<br />I'm going to go along a cultural mix for this Map Idea.
<br />
<br />
<br />Town square would be a large circle. A circular pool of water in the middle. 
<br />
<br />Buildings would surround the town square-- since the town square is, after all, the center of town. 
<br />
<br />Moat around the town.
<br />
<br />Merchants would stand outside their doors, and be within reach of the town square. 
<br />
<br />A large castle would be in the back, kind of like in terthius. This castle would have multiple levels, and a dungeon beneath it, perhaps a portal to ds in the basement.
<br />
<br />
<br />Town guard concepts:
<br />Scallions: 
<br />Guards: Mystic Staff, Mage Hat, and Mystic Leather. (soa would also make guards tougher)
<br />Captains: Altus Lucrum Staff, Adept Hat, Spirit Leather
<br />General: Ominex Staff, Mystic Hat, Dirus Armor
<br />
<br />Gnomes:
<br />Guards: Staff of Almus, Mystic Plate, Mystic Helmet
<br />Captains: Spirit Wand, Spirit Shield, Spirit Helm, Spirit Plate
<br />General: Dirus Armor, Dirus Wand, Shield of Ominex, Omni Helm
<br />
<br />Dregs:
<br />Guards: Mystic Plate, Vita Halberd, Mystic Helm
<br />Captains: Spirit Plate, Sword of Blood, Spirit Shield, Spirit Helm
<br />General: Dirus Armor, Dirus Battle Axe, Omni Shield, Omni Helm
<br />
<br />Elf:
<br />Guards: Lightning Bow, Mystic Scale, Mystic Helmet
<br />Captains: Mystic Bow, Mystic Bone Mail, Spirit Helmet
<br />General: Dirus Armor, Omni Bow, Omni Helmet
<br />
<br />Humans:
<br />Random mix of these</div>

<br />It's still the same basic choice. Ej always meant for scallions to be for wizards/wars even when there were no stat locks.</div>

				<div class="content">Yeah, new map. My idea will make merchants reachable from square or I'll just make the merchants houses like consignment in xen right now, a safe zone. It's stupid to be able to be pked while you're defenseless.</div>

<br />considering donors get to name a guard, I'm guessing there will probably be guards.</div>

				<div class="content">Yes, there are going to be guards.  How the behave will be decided later; they might be castle guards or large-town guards only, or they might only attack monsters.  But there will be guards.</div>

				<div class="content">they add life to the towns. Arguably old xenimus had an empty feeling to it and it was kinda cool but I dont think the game we are making should feel empty at all. Towns need guards, and NPCs to make them feel alive.</div>

				<div class="content">I agree, but I do believe that all towns people can give mini quests..
<br />
<br />NPC &quot;hello and your name is?&quot;
<br />
<br />Player &quot;&lt;name&gt;&quot;
<br />
<br />Npc &quot;Oh, Hello &lt;name&gt; would you mind doing me a favor?&quot;
<br />
<br />Player &quot;not at all&quot;
<br />
<br />NpC &quot;Awesome could you go and pick up some supplies from the &lt;name&gt;&lt;where&gt; if you do this ill give you so much money&quot;
<br />
<br />player &quot;okay&quot;</div>
