				<div class="content">Ok guys, it's finally out!  I'm going to be taking the next few days off to recollect myself so I probably won't release anything new.  This one took all weekend to finish and isn't quite as good as I'd like...(just take a look at the shields...lol) but it's almost midnight and I've put in about 14 hours so far &gt;.&lt;<br /><br /><a href="http://www.unseenstudios.com/evidyon/download/evidyon-setup.msi" class="postlink">http://www.unseenstudios.com/evidyon/download/evidyon-setup.msi</a><br /><br />List of the updates that I can remember off the top of my head:<ul><li>Items show up on characters, but they look crappy...sorry</li><li>New item types</li><li>New monster types</li><li>Geosids are gone near spawn point (whoops, forgot to put them back)</li><li>All character models are smaller.  Tell me what you think.</li><li>Beam effect types.  Check out makrus and putesco.</li><li>More stuff that I can't remember right now</li></ul></div>

Its looking good, and I think its a good start for itemization and looks.<br /><br />On the other hand: Archers on second continent are prob doing arond 2x dmg compared to earlier.<br />Crystals are gone (this you already know of)<br />Imo a too high droprate for rings (especially silver ones.)<br />healing spell is more powerfull = awesome.<br />some helms seem to float over the head. especially on female gnomes.<br />genii's went back to old color. intended?</div>

				<div class="content">The master archers at the graveyard thing below the spawn probably shouldn't be there, also the pile up of monsters there makes the game completely unresponsive and impossible to go to. <br /><br />Character sizes are much better, however now the items are now over sized, helms especially haha.</div>

				<div class="content">Sam is right. But that was actually changed later then when 1.5 was released.<br /><br />When it first came out monsters in continent 2's desert did insane dmg (atleast 2x what they used to, especially archers)<br />When I logged on atleast 10 hours later, the monsters looked different. They did almost no dmg (except the ones in the labyrinth below startpoint,wich do more dmg then they used to and way more then those in desert on continent 2)<br /><br />Also: the drops are changed. Continent #2 mobs dropped the &quot;rare&quot; items + rings.<br />Later on they only dropped the normal gear (all grey on ground) and 0 rings (over atleast 200+ kills)<br /><br />Thats my note atleast. Havent checked today, so i dunno if its changed again. + I also think the amount of gear (the grey gear that is) that drops is boosted. So they drop like 2-5 items at once.</div>

				<div class="content">Overall atm the hard monsters on the first continent (the greenish ones in the graveyard that barely ever spawn^^) are the highest hunt-able monsters.<br />I think they could be hunted from mid tens on (~lvl12-15). The noob ranks on the second continent are slightly easier. And as mentioned the regular second continent mobs couldn't be hunted even with a level30 adept. :p<br /><br />Maybe that helps you a bit with directions. :J</div>

				<div class="content">The mobs that are impossible are the Gendrin with no prefix to their name (like novice etc.) The archers will pretty much 1 hit anyone, the warriors actually don't even attack you however it takes an incredible amount of damage, compared to anything else, to kill them. <br /><br />The monstrosities you moved north-west of the character spawn point are also too hard for the exp they yield. No newb character would stand a chance against them, high enough characters have no use for them as they give next to no exp.<br /><br />Also ran into Gargantua last night, he was 1 hitting me also <img src="./images/smilies/icon_sad.gif" alt=":(" title="Sad" /></div>

				<div class="content">I'm nearly 100% certain it has something to do with mobs being 'loaded' when you approach them.<br />If you get the lag, wait a few seconds untill its completely gone.
