				<div class="content"><span style="font-weight: bold"><span style="font-style: italic">These are the notes on Ender's 3 Oscillator Synthesizer that he has released on board so far.  I'm making this post for organizational purposes, it will be linked to the Condensed Sound Post</span></span>
<br />
<br /><blockquote><div><cite>Ender wrote:</cite>Well I wanted to get this done before I went to bed, so here is the official v.-1 release.  Just so you know I worked on the background for hours <img src="./images/smilies/icon_smile.gif" alt=":)" title="Smile" />.<br /><br />Its a 1.1mb .exe, so if your're worried wait until someone scans it.  Just make sure you correctly enter your account number and secret word when it asks for it.  <br /><br />----EDIT----<br />new link as of 12:36am board time: chorus and reverb were bugged, fixed that.  <br />--------------<br /><br />the link:  <!-- m --><a class="postlink" href="http://rapidshare.com/files/8616126/3x_OSC.exe.html">http://rapidshare.com/files/8616126/3x_OSC.exe.html</a><!-- m -->   (and if you couldn't tell...I was joking about the account number)<br /><br /><br />a few things:<br /><br />1) No install required.  When you start it up, 2 .dat files will be made wherever the .exe is.<br /><br />2) <span style="font-weight: bold">If you start it up and there is no sound, make sure you are on preset 1 (top left corner).</span>  I haven't touched the settings for 2-5, so they were randomly generated and sound like klingon.  Overwrite these with something good ASAP for your sanity.<br /><br />3) The oscillators (OSC) are what generate the sound.  Each has seperate octave and pitch adjustment controls.  These are relative to whatever note you enter (either by left/right clicking on the onscreen piano (right click holds note), or using your keyboard.  (middle C = Q if I remember right).   The type of wave (Sine/Saw/Triangle) dictate what harmonics you are hearing, but I'll save you the theory lesson.<br /><br />4) A S D R  =  Attack,  Sustain,  Decay, and Release.  These are the four factors that determine how a given sound behaves.<br /><br />5)  The filter has its own A S D R control that dictates how frequencies effected by the filter behave.  (example:  if you set up a high pass filter, by editing these you could have the bass boom and then have nothing, have a gentle die out, no bass etc.).  Pay attention to your cutoff frequency when your messing with this.<br /><br />And finally:  <br /><br />This program was made using Outsim's Synthmaker.  You can add your own code and functions to whatever you do, but for this one I didn't, which is why I don't have any source code for you all to look at.  I'd encourage everybody to check the 30 day trial for this sweet program out.  (or just get your pirate on).  Some knowledge about MIDI and Electronics helps a lot, but you can still create stuff without it....it'll just be more of a surprise why it sounds the way it does.</div></blockquote><br /><br /><blockquote><div><cite>Ender wrote:</cite>To Karl G:  I think the sound project is sufficiently developed that we need our own sub-forum...cause this thread is starting to get really cluttered, and its only going to get worse.  I'd suggest having one stickied post with links to all the final versions of songs/FX/programs that we put out.  Then we can have individual posts for specific things we work and collaborate on (such as the 3X OSC I've been spamming this thread with).<br /><br /><br />Speaking of which, I've got the final version to release.  The presets work, and I've got 5 which are good places to start at:<br /><br />This .rar has both the standalone (exe) and VST instrument (the dll):  <br /><br /><!-- m --><a class="postlink" href="http://rapidshare.com/files/8821245/3X_OSC.rar.html">http://rapidshare.com/files/8821245/3X_OSC.rar.html</a><!-- m --><br /><br /><br />About the Presets:<br /><br />1) 8-bit Nintendo:  reminded me of Zelda, so I put it in to play with<br /><br />2-4) Drones that may actually be useful.  Right Clicking a low note, then slowly altering the res and track controls can produce some cool/spooky stuff.<br /><br />5) Reminds me of those annoying toy guns, but somebody might be able to alter the sound to get a decent sound effect or two. (possibly more trouble than its worth)</div></blockquote></div>

				<div class="content">I don't think anyone will actually use that.  I was doing it to learn some stuff so I could make a better one, but then I got sidetracked into something else (as usually happens).  I doubt I'll ever come back to that because right now my classes have me swamped with work.</div>
