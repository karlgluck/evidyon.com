				<div class="content">Hey guys only me,<br /><br />I have been reading the forums all day, almost thread by thread at work...Yes I am extrmeely bored and i'm glad I have volucris to keep me alive!!!..however,<br /><br />I can't help but stop to think how quick this project has come around and to see it has developed so quickly, the amount of work and dedication that Karl has put into this along with us as a community has developed this game where it has come now. And will continue to with future improvements. I find it very hard to believe that the game is months away from completion and being perfectly stable, this has been one SHORT journey. and do you know why?, heart, and pure guts. All of which has come from our creator. My hat goes off even at this stage, remarkable.<br /><br />Such an inspiration, so much dedication...Overall world class.<br /><br /><br />Richard</div>
