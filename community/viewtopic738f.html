				<div class="content">Today, when I disbanded Asgard, I tried to recreate on another character to preserve the name in case I was able to later revive the guild. However the game still thinks that the name is in use and will not allow me to make it. I suspect this will happen if anyone else disbands a guild.</div>

				<div class="content">I've had similar trouble with character names:  sometimes when I delete a character and try to recreate with the same name it is allowed, other times it is not.  I haven't observed whether the game ever &quot;catches up&quot; and updates its list of what's in use and what isn't.</div>

				<div class="content">I have had the same problem Joe.  The explanation I received is that names of guilds/characters/etc. currently have to be manually reset to update their availability.  It should be fixed eventually, but is very low priority.<br /><br />~Erich</div>
