				<div class="content">I think that if you are allowed to change colors at will, clans will naturally ask their members to all wear the same colors.<br /><br />Unlike Xen, I'd like to have 3 colors per character--that way, with more combinations, people can be more unique.</div>

				<div class="content">I think you should be able to color ur armor =) that would be sweet lol. I never liked some of the armors in xen so i would have to go through the xenimus folder and find the file to change the armor and it would take forever.<br /><br />Like, im taking this from WoW, but like make some kind of dye to color your armors and stuff, that would be pretty awesome.</div>

Not for personal expression, just for me. lol<br /><br />But I think everybody needs to look different, so people don't get mixed up.. Which I found to be annoying in Xen lol<br /><br />I knew at least 10 people wearing the same exact Arc Robe and some combo of Wand that were a mix of both friend and foe.. And if they went invis, I was 100% screwed XD</div>
