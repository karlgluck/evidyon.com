				<div class="content">P2P is great and all... but in my opinion thats only for games that can 100% guarantee a player base up in the hundreds of thousands.<br /><br />I believe a big problem of why people didn't try xenimus is because it was a &quot;free trial&quot; and P2P when they've never even heard of it... this was an issue many many many times introducing others to xen.<br /><br />Here's some separate ideas...<br /><br />1) Giving bonuses for paying customers...<br /> - access to special dungeons<br /> - special quests<br /> - +X% EXP<br /> ect...<br /><br />2) Get points to use special item from the Geosids<br /> : say $5 gets you 2,500 points...<br /> : you spend 300 and you can use a temporary NDNT Soul Drainer (weapon); the item would last say 3 days; then break and disappear.<br /> : you can spend 500 to be granted a special personal buff, something like +3% EXP for a duration.<br /><br />3) Restricting unpaid accounts from easily logging in during high population times.<br /><br />4) Limited XX Hours per day.<br /><br />Anything anyone else can come up with?<br /><br />Come on, let's try to think of a way to keep new players coming and hooking them into the game, and encouraging players to spend their money for more than &quot;just to try the game&quot; or &quot;just to play&quot;.</div>

				<div class="content">No real-world wealth for in-game goods.  Perhaps access (to the game or to some dungeons) would work, but absolutely no buying of in-game items.<br /><br />And I rather thought that Xen's system worked well:  a long enough trial period to give somebody an idea of what the game is like, followed by a relatively low monthly fee.</div>

				<div class="content">In principle, I agree that pay for benefits would be ideal.  Getting more people into the game is definitely a priority, since more people = more interaction = more complex game play, which is almost always more fun.  The downside is the complexity that this brings.<br /><br />I agree we can tackle this together--so let's get talking!  I definitely agree with #3:  unpaid accounts should be suppressed somewhat during peak hours.  I don't think a special item is so good, though, because this allows people to essentially buy their power--we can't unbalance the game just because they have money.<br /><br />So I'll just start throwing out ideas.  They aren't winners but just to get us all thinking:<br /><br />Players pay to put &quot;points&quot; on their account.  These points can be used to &quot;energize&quot; a character so that they can gain access to a shrine at a lower level than is otherwise allowed--that way, characters who were paid in the beginning would end up somewhat stronger than those who didn't.  These shrines would be available to everyone at a certain level.<br /><br />Players lose EXP when they die, unless they use points to remove this effect.<br /><br />Players can buy &quot;protection&quot; for an item they own, which will cause it to become NDNT.  Possibly, this NDNT could be non-permanent (based of # of deaths, time period)<br /><br />Forming a permanent &quot;guild&quot; has a start-up cost (guilds are distinct from parties--parties are just informal groups).  Joining a guild could cost $$ also.  It could be set up such that a guild gets &quot;guild points&quot; based on how much they charge to admit new members.  These guild points could be used to buy guildhalls, castles, shared mounts, territory, items, upgrades for owned structures (such as guards), etc...<br /><br /><br />Unfortunately only the last guild idea has a semi-regular payment period.  The issue is that some of these get a small amount of income, once.  After that...nothing!  And I still have to pay a monthly cost for server space.</div>

				<div class="content">Thanks Joe!! Having a way to evaluate these methods will make this much easier to debate in a useful way.<br /><br />The problem I see with the methods that pass this first 'coarse' test is that they do not provide a constant source of payment, and it is difficult to imagine an intuitive way to allow players to pre-pay.<br /><br />I think that the maximum hours per day thing might be a workable alternative to pay-for-time.  That way, people who really like the game could support it and gain even more access.  What about kicking unpaid accounts when the server is full and a paid client wants to log in?<br /><br />The exclusive dungeons might be toeing the line.  If an exclusive dungeon is inherently better due to fewer players, more spawn or easier/higher EXP monsters, then it is nearly the same as a player buying enhancement for him/herself.  If it isn't inherently better, then why would players want to pay to get access to it?</div>

Accounts inactive for a while are deleted.  This provides a constant flow of money without unreasonably advantaging paid accounts.<br /><br /><blockquote class="uncited"><div>The exclusive dungeons might be toeing the line.

There doesn't seem to be a difference between what you fear in this case (more/better places to level --&gt; more powerful characters) and a time restriction (more time to level --&gt; more powerful characters).<br /><br />Of course there is some advantage to be gained by paying, but that's just the nature of the paying/not-paying split.</div>

				<div class="content">So the underlying idea is the same as what we've discussed, though you've, pointed to two options that we haven't specifically addressed:<br /><br />*  Access to the Bazaar.<br />*  Access to (as opposed to the direct buying of) special items.<br /><br />I'm not sure how to classify the first:  it seems similar to &lt;(P.C) Access to social content&gt;, but there is a distinction.  A similar idea might be &lt;Access to world chat&gt;:  Access to in-game utilities.  These seem to pass our test--no direct buying of power--but might not be a good idea.<br /><br />Similarly, it seems that &lt;Access to special items&gt; would pass our test, but might not be a good idea.<br /><br />So:<br />We have three new proposals:  &lt;Access to special items&gt;; &lt;Access to in-game utilities:  Bazaar&gt;; &lt;Access to in-game utilities:  World Chat&gt;.<br />All three seem to pass our initial test, though whether or not they should be implemented is questionable.<br />What do y'all think:  do they pass or fail, and if they do pass, should they be implemented, why or why not?</div>

				<div class="content">I have a new idea: expansion packs.  I know, this sounds a little WoW-ish, but bear with me.<br /><br />The basic game is free, perhaps limited by hours/day or something.  However, there are areas of the game accessible via dungeon entrances, portals, boats, etc. that are considered &quot;expansion&quot; areas.  These areas are actually on different servers.  When a player pays for an expansion, the updater downloads the content pack (including new maps/monsters/whatever) and the server allows them to travel to that region.<br /><br /><br />Oh, and as far as those ideas go:  I agree that they pass the test, but I don't think that they should be implemented.  They seem too severely restrictive.</div>
