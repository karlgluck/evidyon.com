				<div class="content">Me and Marzuku tested our speeds together on skeleton.  At the same level (25) With a 4 Agility difference there was less than a 5% increase in speed.  Compared to other stats which have an apprx. 20% dif after 5 stat points on average.  (these estimates aren't anywhere near to exact, but aren't exaggerateratively high or low)  I understand that there would be a dif depending where in the range we were ( a 30-34 stat diff would have a smaller effect than a 20-24 stat dif due to the way stats stack) I was 20 agil he was 24 agil, I consider this to be low agility for meelee classes.  so the difference should have been more effective if my perspective is correct.<br /><br />Maybe agility's value curve is set higher than other stats? I know agility is supposed to be effective for mages and meelee, but neither class has expressed much advantage.  If anyone would like to build a character of reversed stats to mine (str and agil reversed) I'll pm you my stats and we'll test dps.</div>
