				<div class="content">So I been on a forgotten realms reading kick again and got an idea.  This would probably be for the far future, but I think its pretty neat and would encourage larger parties of players.<br /><br />This would be something used once you have gotten into a REALLY difficult and far-away area with a larger party.  Having the ability to craft a mini mythal of sorts.  It would require multiple casters (probably of several varieties) and they would all have to be of a set minimum level.  The casting would take a fair amt of time and during it the casters would be unable to attack/defend.  This casting would also increase the spawn of monsters around it and the other party members would have to defend them.  The result would be a safe zone out in that area.  No monsters would spawn inside it and they wouldn't like to come near it.  Within it you could even open a portal or something.  There is a lot more you could probably add on to something like this, but thats all I can come up with off the top of my head right now.</div>
