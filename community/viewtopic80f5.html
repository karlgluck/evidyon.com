				<div class="content">Quests are *definitely* needed in this game to keep things interesting.  Creating a variety of engaging quests is high on my priority list, but will take a back seat to more pressing matters for the time being.  However, if you have creative ideas for new types of quests, please post them.  It's easy to generate a &quot;kill X monsters in Y period of time in Z area&quot; quest, but it's more interesting to have other types--the sky's the limit!</div>

				<div class="content">&quot;Bring me a shrubbery!&quot; ^_^<br />Or more simply: &quot;Bring me x number of item y. I need them for my potions/girlfriend/bar mitzva!&quot;<br /><br />Some more sophisticated (and obviously stolen) ideas:<br />- Retrieve a special item from a dangerous place (&quot;Get the spear of the mighty troll king!&quot;)<br /><br />- Escort a npc on a certain route which leads through dangerous terrain (&quot;Elvis wants to pick some flowers for his love, but unfortunately those flowers only grow in the dervali desert. Would you escort and protect him?&quot;)<br /><br />- Sneak n' Hide tasks, mucho like 'splinter cell' (&quot;The master grendans are planning something, we need a brave hero to infiltrate their castle and collect informations. But be careful, you must not be seen or else the observation will fail!&quot;)<br /><br />- The beloved 'carry' tasks (&quot;Merchant Beeblebrox needs this book. He lives down the road. Please go and bring him the book.&quot;)<br /><br />I may have missed some here. But from that 'pool' you can combine quests to create quest-chains that make a whole 'story-arc'.<br />Best example for that would be wow, where like every storyline is built up with an assortment of quests from those categories. But please no instances. :p<br /><br />Edit: what's wrong with ascent? o0</div>

				<div class="content">I'm not trying to get into an argument here but I am not assuming anything. You wanted a reply to your post as you have just stated and didn't get one. Karl will still take it all in. I know it looks like it was in direct response to your post and it may very well be but he may have only had the time to make one quick post and thought for this period in time that making a post about quests was more important, I don't know as I am not Karl but you don't need to make demands that he replies to posts, which is how what you posted came across.</div>

				<div class="content">That was a classic quote from 'army of darkness'. :p<br /><br />I just had a new idea for quests.<br />I remembered a gamemode from unreal tournament, called invasion. In that the participants had to fight incoming waves of enemies for a set amount of time. Even if only one survived the group won that game.<br />That led me to the idea to include something like that in evidyon, you could call it &quot;defensive quests&quot; to give it a label of some sort.<br />It could be used at the end of a quest-chain for example, AND it could be used to create group-quests.<br />For example you recieve a group quest to retrieve and guard an old artifact. You create/join a group and you all fight your way through the dungeon.<br />At the end theres an altar with the artifact to take (would be cool if only one needs to pick it up for all ppl). The artifact triggers the 'defensive' part, you mustn't leave a certain area and survive the following x minutes to complete the task. The group-bonus would be that only one of the whole group has to survive and every dead player gets resurrected afterwards incase someone survived the waves.<br /><br />Actually my example wasn't that great, defending some stronghold or a castle or an old grandma would be a more fitting scene (or starship troopers lulz).</div>
