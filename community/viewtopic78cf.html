Can you try to confirm this?<br /><br /><blockquote><div><cite>Joelshup wrote:</cite>:!: Leaping over a pit still doesn't let you continue to leap. I died 15k penalty.</div></blockquote><br />Ironically enough, fixing the spin bug (the one that prevented you from changing direction while casting whirlwind) broke leaping.  Thanks, I have added a fix for this!<br /><br /><blockquote><div><cite>Morn wrote:</cite>:!:The specs for Spectral throwing knives are less than lightning, yet it's a higher lvl item, this didn't seem intentional with your current system</div></blockquote><br />Fixed.<br /><br /><blockquote><div><cite>Joelshup wrote:</cite> <img src="images/smilies/icon_idea.gif" alt=":idea:" title="Idea" /> Could it be possible for loot to not be so random please.

We have no idea how well players are going to be able to fight monsters.  I could design a monster, call it level 1 and no level 20 player would be able to kill him.  These things are hard to estimate, and I think what we have now is a fairly good balance considering the billions of different player types that can be created.<br /><br /><blockquote><div><cite>Joelshup wrote:</cite>:!: Rage seems to not give enough life steal and takes away too much hp for it to be useful.

I thought this last edition would be an interesting diversion from &quot;safe&quot; gameplay, but I see that since fig types lack a basic buff that's needed first before we get fancy.  In this next update, I'm trying out something new that is a more standard buff.   It should also solve the problem of hunters not having enough MP and fighters not doing enough damage.<br /><br /><br />Ok, that's all for now!</div>

I hope this does get fixed fast because that 2 - 3 seconds is all that takes for someone die and it's not their fault.<br /><br /> <img src="images/smilies/icon_exclaim.gif" alt=":!:" title="Exclamation" /> Is it possible for Fiery Icons or Earthen Emblem to give armor? I mean even Wooden Rings give you armor, I find it wierd that these higher level rings don't give armor.<br /><br /> <img src="images/smilies/icon_exclaim.gif" alt=":!:" title="Exclamation" /> Another possibility perhaps, could boots get a +% movement speed just like gloves give +% attack speed.</div>
