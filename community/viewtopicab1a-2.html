				<div class="content">When Beta comes out can the Alpha players keep their much loved characters?<br /><br />++<br /><br />Also, I think the map still needs alot of work. It looks slightly unprofessional where things are situated! Pretty much the whole area around the town should be redone in my opinion to make the game seem more homely at first. Also, I don't think crawlers should drop armour/weapons. Just MO!<br /><br />+ I think the server is down ATM.</div>

				<div class="content">- Atleast for me the server is down aswell (infact with this update i never experienced it being up, wth karl :p )<br /><br />- Our players will be wiped most likely, they allready were wiped a few updates ago (i think i was the highest lvl pre-wipe, ahum hehe) - Since a selected bunch had a unreasonable head start wiping is justified imo<br /><br />- same goes for items...obviously<br /><br />- Map i dunno, should depend on the method karl is going with; for example continously adding content in the alpha untill there's a reasonable mapped world for beta or staying with a small map and focusing on game mechanics/coding - adding a new full map in beta then<br /><br />- Please not a xen-map copy<br /><br />- Oh, and not to forget, axel sux :ö</div>

				<div class="content">The server is up.<br /><br />Characters will probably be wiped for Beta, but I'm not sure about that yet.<br /><br />We should have an entirely new map for Beta, but that might change depending on how the rest of the work is going.  We certainly will have a new map by commercial.  Nor will it be a copy of the Xenimus map--that map has major, major problems--but certain elements may be incorporated:  what about that map did you think worked well?</div>

				<div class="content"><blockquote><div><cite>Joe M. wrote:</cite>The server is up.</div></blockquote><br /><br />Not for me. Maybe there are some issues with either the server or the new version? I allready tried de-installing and re-installing.<br />The launcher allways updates some files the first time i start it, but that's it; &quot;Connecting...&quot; is all i get to see when i hit play (Version 2.8.0). Never had any issues with previous versions and it's still running on the same system. o_0<br /><br />Edit: I have a suspicion, trying something out and reporting back.<br /><br />Edit²: 'Ere we go, my suspicion was right:<br />I let the 2.8.0 evidyon installer remove the previous version and installed it in the same directory. <span style="font-weight: bold">The installer though does not delete the config.ini nor overwrite it with the new installation</span>. Since the [network] line changed, from &quot;Server1=poorserver.no-ip.org&quot; (lulz) in my version to &quot;Server1=66.90.87.83&quot; in the current version evidyon could not connect to the server. :p<br /><br />Might be good to know for upcoming config changes (maybe just include the newest config in the files that get downloaded by the launcher if that's possible? Because the launcher seemed not affected by the ip from the config file).</div>

				<div class="content">grrr...I hate installers<br /><br /><br />As far as characters go, if I can swing it I'd like to give you one of a few options:<br />1- buried: you get a grave and tombstone permanently in the world that displays your name to others<br />2- frozen:  they aren't destroyed, but they can't attack anything and their spells have no effect.  your character also wouldn't be able to drop items (even if you'd want to)<br />3- deleted:  just gone</div>

				<div class="content">Hehe cool ideas. Personally i'd like a statue or something, but a grave would be fine too.<br /><br />Overall though the &quot;ineffective&quot; idea sounds like the best solution - ppl could still &quot;show off&quot; their work in beta that way and it should be less work and debates over who deserves a statue and who not and so on. ;p</div>
