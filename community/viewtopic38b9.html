				<div class="content">Morning guys and gals.  Just doing my morning check in to see what's new and i started thinking when the PV website popped up.  There hasn't been a news update since January and I thought it might be a good idea to maybe post something there to the effect that Alpha is coming up and any new info will be added to the Wiki or something like that.  I know Karl must be swamped with pv and work and stuff but for someone just coming to the site it looks like nothing is going on.  I know most would say they just need to hit the forums to see activity but your average interenet user isn't all that bright lol.  Just an idea.  Im getting really excited about PV!~</div>
