				<div class="content">Hey karlito,<br />after a longer absence i checked in again to see how's it going. And it looks like it's going quite good, it's pretty much an entirely different game since the last time i logged on lol.<br /><br />However onward to the question, apparently there is some day/night change and i can't see poo at night. Is there a way to get some sort of night vision or a light source? I checked everything on my knight but couldn't find anything. :รถ</div>

				<div class="content">Night actually doesn't get so dark right now--I can see just fine at night.  Hm.  For now, try raising your brightness?  The lighting is going to change sometime in the next couple days (as in, we're going to *have* lighting  <img src="images/smilies/icon_razz.gif" alt=":P" title="Razz" />).</div>

				<div class="content">Ugh yeah well that works, i'd call it a temporary solution though (since that brightness is not healthy for any other things running lol).<br />Maybe it's the windowed mode fuxxing a bit with the general settings of my card, ahwell. Regardless of that, thumbs up to karl for the progress. :J</div>
