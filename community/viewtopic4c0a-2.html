				<div class="date"><img src="./styles/prosilver/imageset/icon_post_target.gif" width="11" height="9" alt="Post" title="Post" />Posted: <strong>Tue Jan 13, 2009 8:35 am</strong></div>

				<div class="content">So here's what's going on:  there were a couple bugs in the world manager that were causing weird stuff, one of them I haven't figured out yet.  After running for more than a couple of hours, about half of the world's spawned monsters become &quot;zombies&quot;: they are present in the world, but they don't move, die or interact with the rest of the world at all.  Spending time trying to get this fixed has delayed the implementation of equipment slightly, which pushed into my world-development time, etc.<br /><br />As much as I want this thing to go out now, I think that putting out something half-assed and semifunctional is worse than delaying it until the end of this week.  I should know by now that just because I set a date doesn't mean that's how it's going to happen <img src="./images/smilies/icon_rolleyes.gif" alt=":roll:" title="Rolling Eyes" /> <br /><br />I promise to keep you all posted.  I am traveling back to Ithaca tomorrow, but will be working between packing and doing laundry today and while on the plane.</div>

				<div class="content">Hey, that's no problemo at all. Contrary to the other single-man devs i know (and that's not only ej, allthough he's a perfect example of &quot;bad habits&quot;) you keep us up-to-date with what you're doing and you're even posting media - not to mention the insane speedy process the last half year.<br />So don't put yourself under unneeded pressure with this - i think we're all happy with knowing that evidyons next step is pretty close, like allready peeking around the corner. And i bet joe agrees with me here. :J<br /><br />Edit: Aye btw, are the houses (unlike in xen) completely polygonic? Because your &quot;style&quot; looks much better. The viewpoint is too zoomed in for my taste though.</div>

				<div class="content">Thanks everyone <img src="./images/smilies/icon_smile.gif" alt=":)" title="Smile" />  I'm working hard!<br /><br /><blockquote><div><cite>Sankt Pauli wrote:</cite>...are the houses (unlike in xen) completely polygonic?

I am going to make the &quot;inside&quot; of the houses on a second map so that the insides can be designed separately--thus, you can have multi-level houses and other cool stuff.<br /><br />Does the viewpoint feel too zoomed in because of the house size?  I'm able to easily adjust the scale of everything on the map, so I'd definitely like some feedback on this.</div>
