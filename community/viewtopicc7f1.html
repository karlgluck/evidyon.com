				<div class="content">Hey guys!
<br />
<br />I've been *really* busy with schoolwork and with taekwondo this past month.  One of those will go away.  I'm up for a world championship with the other, and I'd never give it up anyway.  <img src="images/smilies/icon_smile.gif" alt=":)" title="Smile" />
<br />
<br />As a result, I haven't had as much time as I'd like to sit down and think about ways to make BtR awesome.
<br />
<br />So for now, all I can say is that we're working hard at our meetings and at our respective homes, and you'll see the results soon enough.  Some of the problem right now is just slogging through and getting a lot of the groundwork laid, but after this phase, things should go much more quickly.
<br />
<br />Other than design, I'm working (when I get the time) to learn to animate meshes, so that David doesn't have to do everything himself.  I think it'll be pretty easy, just tedious.  But whatever gets things done!
<br />
<br />I'm heading to bed, so you guys take it easy.
<br />
<br />Peace,
<br />Joe M.</div>
