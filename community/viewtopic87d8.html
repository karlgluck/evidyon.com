				<div class="content">Ok, well here goes!  I have a bunch of shots, and I'll give a little history.<br /><br />I started Xenimus as early as November 11, 2001 (that's when my first screenshot is dated) and played with my little brother.  I was 13, he was 11.  (he's the little dude in white helping me kill the dragon, which was stuck in the T3 merchant's basement!)  I had no idea what to do, but I had a lot of fun running around and flamma-ing things and hanging out with some guy named ACIDRAINMAIN.  He could make a cool cloud of green stuff, which I liked.  Also I thought Nocte Visus changed day to night for everyone, so I spent twenty minutes trying to show someone I met in game that I could change the world at level 1 <img src="images/smilies/icon_razz.gif" alt=":P" title="Razz" /><br /><br />To make a long story short, I played for a while and had a kickass time killing &amp; being killed, then got banned from it by my parents and which made me decide to make my own game--after all, they couldn't keep me from playing something I made, right??<br /><br />Here are the glory-days screenshots.   I have no idea where I got The Tree of Hope from!<br /><br /><img src="../temp/xenshots/old/X1.html" alt="Image" /><br /><img src="../temp/xenshots/old/X2.html" alt="Image" /><br /><img src="../temp/xenshots/old/X3.html" alt="Image" /><br /><img src="../temp/xenshots/old/X4.html" alt="Image" /><br /><img src="../temp/xenshots/old/X5.html" alt="Image" /><br /><img src="../temp/xenshots/old/X6.html" alt="Image" /><br /><img src="../temp/xenshots/old/X7.html" alt="Image" /><br /><img src="../temp/xenshots/old/X8.html" alt="Image" /><br /><img src="../temp/xenshots/old/X9.html" alt="Image" /><br /><img src="../temp/xenshots/old/X10.html" alt="Image" /><br /><img src="../temp/xenshots/old/X11.html" alt="Image" /><br /><img src="../temp/xenshots/old/X12.html" alt="Image" /><br /><img src="../temp/xenshots/old/X13.html" alt="Image" /><br /><img src="../temp/xenshots/old/X14.html" alt="Image" /><br /><br />These are from early 2002, when I played frequently.  Although the JPGs are dated october 2002, the original BMPs (which I still have!) are dated between march 2002 and july 2002.  I stopped playing in august, but still visited the forums.<br />This is one of my all-time favorites.  Bonk Von Fuzzlewack took me to the GH for free, and really got me started playing.<br /><img src="../temp/xenshots/old/X15.html" alt="Image" /><br /><br /><img src="../temp/xenshots/old/X16.html" alt="Image" /><br /><img src="../temp/xenshots/old/X17.html" alt="Image" /><br /><img src="../temp/xenshots/old/X18.html" alt="Image" /><br /><br />These are from mid-2002:<br /><img src="../temp/xenshots/old/X19.html" alt="Image" /><br /><img src="../temp/xenshots/old/X20.html" alt="Image" /><br /><img src="../temp/xenshots/old/X21.html" alt="Image" /><br /><br /><br />These are from outside of the folder that is labeled on the disc as &quot;old&quot;, and are in no particular order:<br /><img src="../temp/xenshots/1%20mans%20fate.html" alt="Image" /><br /><img src="../temp/xenshots/2%20helpers.html" alt="Image" /><br /><img src="../temp/xenshots/2%20helpers2.html" alt="Image" /><br /><img src="../temp/xenshots/Barbian%20Lord.html" alt="Image" /><br /><br />This one was taken when EJ added the blue egg+white-pot spell for high level clerics.  I was allied with Bonk when he was the first to get it <img src="images/smilies/icon_smile.gif" alt=":)" title="Smile" />.  Baron Van Clyde was my super kick-bum theif:  at only level 18 (this was WAY before multi, remember--leveling was a dog) he could take on lvl 26 mages and win.  I took down a guy with blue egg once by jumping him with some reds and a white pot.  Holy crap the adrenaline was ridiculous <img src="images/smilies/icon_razz.gif" alt=":P" title="Razz" /><br /><img src="../temp/xenshots/Baron%20With%20Egg.html" alt="Image" /><br /><img src="../temp/xenshots/Barth%20PK.html" alt="Image" /><br /><img src="../temp/xenshots/Claree%20Quest.html" alt="Image" /><br /><img src="../temp/xenshots/Clones.html" alt="Image" /><br /><img src="../temp/xenshots/Collage.html" alt="Image" /><br /><img src="../temp/xenshots/Corsix%20-%20T7.html" alt="Image" /><br /><img src="../temp/xenshots/CROWDED%20t7.html" alt="Image" /><br /><img src="../temp/xenshots/Dead%20Guard%20Mage.html" alt="Image" /><br /><img src="../temp/xenshots/Dead%20Guard.html" alt="Image" /><br /><img src="../temp/xenshots/DS%20Cliff%202.html" alt="Image" /><br /><img src="../temp/xenshots/DS%20Cliff.html" alt="Image" /><br /><img src="../temp/xenshots/ds%20coffins.html" alt="Image" /><br /><img src="../temp/xenshots/Ecro%20in%20Agility.html" alt="Image" /><br /><img src="../temp/xenshots/Ecro%20in%20ds%20arena.html" alt="Image" /><br /><img src="../temp/xenshots/Ecro%20PKin%20Dalamars%20Newbie.html" alt="Image" /><br />This picture was &quot;faked&quot; since I wasn't high enough level to have bomb yet (only 25, clerics got at 27)<br /><img src="../temp/xenshots/Ecrofresha%20-%20Bomb.html" alt="Image" /><br /><img src="../temp/xenshots/Ecrofresia%20in%20Masters.html" alt="Image" /><br /><img src="../temp/xenshots/fighters.html" alt="Image" /><br /><br />Figured out how to switch fireball for chicken! lol <img src="images/smilies/icon_biggrin.gif" alt=":D" title="Very Happy" /><br /><img src="../temp/xenshots/Flaming%20Chickens%21.html" alt="Image" /><br /><br />There was a bug at one point that if gnomes put on a scale mail (I think) they got super huge.<br /><img src="../temp/xenshots/Gnome%20bug.html" alt="Image" /><br /><img src="../temp/xenshots/Gnome%20King.html" alt="Image" /><br /><br />When I first saw this thing, I was like O.o<br /><img src="../temp/xenshots/Hammer%20of%20Ominex.html" alt="Image" /><br /><img src="../temp/xenshots/Jorn.html" alt="Image" /><br /><img src="../temp/xenshots/klorgInWoods.html" alt="Image" /><br /><br />My brother and I made twins--&quot;Life&quot; and &quot;Death&quot;.  I was a warlock, he was a wizard.  We were all-intel, and sat in DS mana pools pking together.<br /><img src="../temp/xenshots/Life%20-%20Arena.html" alt="Image" /><br /><img src="../temp/xenshots/Lis%20of%20DS.html" alt="Image" /><br /><br />LUKE2 was EJ's friend, and got a char with crossbeam/bomb.

This trick was to create a fireball on the edge of your screen and -battle to make it go offscreen and kill one of the insane guardians.<br /><img src="../temp/xenshots/Viontel%20almost%20at%20the%20end%20of%20dd.html" alt="Image" /><br /><img src="../temp/xenshots/Viontel%20at%20the%20end%20of%20dd.html" alt="Image" /><br /><br />My friend Volrath and I went to DD to kill stuff.  He was...oh...high level 40's HP paladin, I was level 31 cleric w/ really fast reaction time.  We still died, and I dropped my 7p mystic plate (Best item I owned, ever!  I never owned a spirit item or higher, until someone who I gave my account to found the first dirus leather in adepts...a few days after I abandoned the game)<br /><img src="../temp/xenshots/Volrath%20an%20me%20dead%20in%20DD.html" alt="Image" /><br /><img src="../temp/xenshots/Wing%20of%20Dragon%20-%20Rog.html" alt="Image" /><br /><img src="../temp/xenshots/Wing%20of%20Dragon%20in%20Masters.html" alt="Image" /><br /><img src="../temp/xenshots/Wing%20of%20Dragon.html" alt="Image" /><br /><img src="../temp/xenshots/Wraiths%20Chicken.html" alt="Image" /></div>

Unless you're talking yen, there is no freaking way.  Even if you're talking about a 40 hour work week, that's 2400 minutes.  2400 minutes at $40 a minute = $96,000 a week, at $5.00 a month, that's 4,800 active accounts.</div>

				<div class="content">Say you did max out the servers, that's 300 different accounts at $5 per month.  That's $1500 a month.  I'm sorry but at least be somewhat close to a ballpark number if you're going to guess at Ej's income.  That works out to roughly 15.63 cents a minute, and $9.38 an hour.  That's barely a buck over California minimum wage.</div>

				<div class="content">This is Karl's dad typing to you ON that old computer...  I've wiped the hard drives of data, about to use Eraser to secure them and was cleaning up Firefox when it loaded to Karl's default web site - this one of course!  Glad to see the recovery effort was worth something  <img src="images/smilies/icon_biggrin.gif" alt=":D" title="Very Happy" /> <br /><br />Actually the first computer Karl used was a Zenith 286 (287 math co-processor!) with a 40MB hard drive.  And he actually started programming much earlier than 13 - he was building simulations using &quot;Logo&quot; - an object oriented language programming much earlier than 13, I think about 7 or 8.<br /><br />OK enough nostalgia from the notorious &quot;parentage&quot;  <img src="images/smilies/icon_twisted.gif" alt=":twisted:" title="Twisted Evil" /> !
