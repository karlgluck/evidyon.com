				<div class="content">Just like to give my thanks and appreciation for your achievements with this project! I can speak for a lot of us when I say we're very excited to see where Evidyon is heading!<br /><br />Just a little FYI for everyone, when Xenimus was first introduced as Beta there were no walking or attacking animations (you literally floated around like ghosts) and content was limited as EJ had no intentions for players passing level12. I won't even get into customer service..<br /><br />If things keep progressing this smoothly a beta by December (I believe that's what I read somewhere) is a very realistic goal. Ultimately I'd love to see Evidyon grow and become a competitive title in the online RPG market and I really believe this to be possible with proper planning and marketing.<br /><br />To Karl, salute!</div>
