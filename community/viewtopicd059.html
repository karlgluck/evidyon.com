				<div class="content">If you are killed by a Guard and you have a lsa on (can't remember their names) you will instantly be dead again if you type /standup. This is incredibly unfair for someone who is evil and went into town to pk. It should at least give a chance to get up and run. Also it's annoying if you accidentally hit a guard and that happens.</div>
