				<div class="content">I think you underestimate the power of liquidity, Marz.  Gold will become important (if not all-important) once it starts to flow.  Right now it's only trickling into the game, but once we get quests and an NPC merchant up and more variable drops on the gold there will be enough around to actually use.</div>
