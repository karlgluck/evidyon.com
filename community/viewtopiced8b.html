				<div class="content">Well firstly i thought the game was about creating your own character by giving him personally designed stats so he/she is a unique build/character.<br />Requiering a level and on top of that a stats requierement totally slaughters that idea logically.<br />Ill explain: with this current system you get forced to put on stats where you dont want them this therfore makes you a character of what the creators decided not yourself the only customization will be like 1 or two stats difference.<br /><br />Example of something that happened: lvled a caster named FrankTheTank and noticed at level 20 that i could not wield any wepons because i had to much intel compared to wisdom which i needed to wield the gear, i will therefore be forced to wait for reset or put all my stats in wisdom as i level to be able to wield wepons intended for my class.<br /><br />Suggesting Class &amp; level req, instead of the current system stat level req, or else nobody will truly be free to create own characters with different traits than others.</div>

				<div class="content">I think they intended for gear to be a consideration when you were making a build.  For example, my no wis build adept can only equip every other orb and wand set, as the reqs alternate between int and wis.  I think once there is more gear in the game we'll see this effect people's decisions more often.</div>

				<div class="content">Well, currently ALL item requirements, be it strength, wisdom, or intelligence, is (for earth, holy, lightning, spectral, [and unconfirmed but I think acid as well]) <span style="font-weight: bold"><span style="text-decoration: underline">22</span></span> For a mage to have at least 22 wisdom and intelligence is quite normal. Same goes for hunters/warriors to have 22 strength.</div>
