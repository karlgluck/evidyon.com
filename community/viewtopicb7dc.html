As stated on Evidyon.com<br />Be there, and lets get some sweet screenshots taken!<br />This release will be the real map for Beta and the Final game with actual hunting areas, only the map that is going to be released Sunday will be a very small fraction of what the final map size will be, say 5-10%.<br /><br />I think we are all stoked and ready, I look forward to seeing ya'll in game.</div>

				<div class="content">Yes, your gold will be kept and xp will not change.<br />Penalty xp and an inventory wipe are the changes that will affect the players.<br /><br />Penalty xp will be set to zero.  So when the level cap is raised to 40 it wont take you forever to work off that insane amount of negative xp that has built up.  For me I have -1.3 million xp, would take quite a while to get back to leveling. <br /><br />The inventory has to be wiped because of weapon level adjustments.  Some weapons that are in game now will be higher level weapons in Beta, some weapons will also be made more rare.  The point of the weapon wipe is to set everyone back even, so a player that has a rare weapon in Pre-Beta will not be all powerful if that weapon is set to be a super rare weapon in Beta.</div>

It is 99% of the way there, I just haven't found a good way to make the power of an enchantment increase with level.  It's a pretty complicated problem and I don't have a great solution just yet.  On the upside, I don't think this will affect the gameplay too much before I get it fixed =D</div>

				<div class="content">Glad to hear it =D<br /><br />So I've finished uploading the new database, but there was a small snafu--when I raised the level cap, I started getting a divide-by-zero error on server startup.  The fix requires me to recompile, but it'll be much quicker.  Then upload!</div>
