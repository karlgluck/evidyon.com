Longbow costs more mp usage, only kills 2 targets at a time if it hits at all(as it is now)<br /><br />2.The range of clicking on a monster with longbow is still at melee range so it means your character will move to the apointed target until it is melee range close and then start shooting arrows.<br /><br />3. and yeah you start with 140-ish mana when wisdom is at 10, second you add one stat you go down to 50.</div>
