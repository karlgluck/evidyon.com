				<div class="content">Well on the night of this post, about 7 or 8 of us at square has a showdown. (Evidyon Kings vs A few good men) Most of us I think enjoyed it, of course there was some arguing over who stole whos gear. I would like to address that by saying if you knew you were going to pvp, and chose to, you should have been prepared for what you may lose. For the most part the battle seemed pretty ballanced. <br />The exception I paticularly noticed was be Corsix. If you would please Corsix post your character class/level/stats (unless they are a secret), it may be of some help. His attacks were BLAZING FAST! And they werent weak. I am a level 34 Sorceror. I have 245 armor when buffed and around 600hp+. He can kill me in, without exaggeration, less than a second. He was wielding two Lightning kris. When he attacks, in the 1/5th of a second reaction time most humans have (add a few more tenths for the circumstances), I ussualy manage to trans to square with about 1/10th or less of my normal hp. (guessing around 60ish-) Keep in mind I was prepared to be attacked.</div>

				<div class="content">Glad you guys had fun!<br /><br />About the velocitas thing:  OOPS!  That was a hold-over from before I had tested things out, and it got un-fixed in one of the releases I put out.  It was giving people a speed buff 10x greater than the fastest hunter's speed buff.  That fix is going out asap.<br /><br />As for the agility scaling, I'm testing now to see what's up with that.</div>

				<div class="content">If you are going to nerf agility spell you should also nerf that spell that hunters have where they deal an extreme amount of damage with one shot.  Some level 20-24 hunter does like 95% of my hp in one shot, then finishes me off with the second.  Literally two shots and I am dead on a levle 25+ warrior. <br /><br />And if you are going to nerf agility spell, please make the actual agility stat do more.  Warriors are poo because their attacks are so slow even with a decent amount of agility.  The only way they could actually compete with other classes was with the agility buff, or else they would be punching bags.</div>
