				<div class="content">Just posting to let everybody know I haven't left the project or anything... the attic of my house caught on fire and all of the electricity was shut off... this all happened on the 1st. It should be fixed sometime soon, I'm using a friend's computer.<br /><br />Will be back soon hopefully.<br /><br />P.S. Nobody was hurt.<br /><br /><br />EDIT:<br />I may not be able to get on for a while again... people are coming in to clean up the mess and redo the walls and carpet of the house, we're all being forced out of the house for up to about 3 weeks... I'm probably still going to have some computer access, though it may not be my computer.<br /><br />Welp, gotta go pack up, gotta have us out by 8 AM tomorrow.</div>
