				<div class="content">I have to say I agree with Vitriol on this one.  Even though losing gear REALLY sucks, it's exactly how much it sucks that makes battles so intense.  We can still make it so you only drop one item when you die, but it's that random chance that it'll be your best item that makes the game so fun.
<br />
<br />There will be plenty of &quot;safe&quot; areas to PVP just for kicks, though (the arena)</div>

				<div class="content">I figure if someone 10 levels over you kill you, you should only drop 1 item, otherwise you drop it all.
<br />Im far less concerned about high levels killing low levels than i am about high levels killing mid levels. There is no economic reason to kill lower levels for a higher level player. The only people who do are the terror pks who kill for fun. Those guys have to be dealt with by pk hunters. But otherwise, no high level wants your spiked mace.</div>

				<div class="content">im not reffering to losing my &quot;spiked mace&quot; i am talking about the high levels pking the mid levels, and me or anyone else losing mystic gear or spirit gear things like that. 
<br />
<br />If we dont have bags players should only drop ONE item. the thought of losing your best item would keep you on your toes im sure.
<br />
<br />as i said before there has to be a safe guard against higher level pkers.
<br />
<br />the fear of losing Everything would prevent 90% of players from leveling, or even exploring!.... maybe thats why people on early xen never leveld much...  cuz stepping off square was way to risky.
<br />
<br />if you want all gear to drop. I imagine there will only be 10-20 players. after losing everything 2-3 times most people would quit. the system u want to use is OVERKILL harsh.
<br />
<br />Some good solution must be presented. and accepted by everyone</div>

<br />
<br />i can agree with this
<br />
<br />by 10 level pk buffer you mean if im level 20 and a level 30 pks me i wouldnt drop nething besides inventory? But if he is 29 i would drop one Random item equipped?

				<div class="content">I vote no bags now.  Not like it would effect pvp any, ud just have a bunch of people sq pvping or pvping nearly naked cus who in their right mind would pvp with a 100% chance to drop all gear and nearly a 100% chance of unseen teaming. Make a poll or something so it will be clear what more people would enjoy more. But now i vote no bags just so a month after the game is out I can watch bags get added and come back and say we told you so..  <img src="./images/smilies/icon_biggrin.gif" alt=":D" title="Very Happy" /> 
<br />
<br />But im all for Vitriol and Thad having 100% bag failures if the game does have bags, cus they are hardcore players and all.  <img src="./images/smilies/icon_biggrin.gif" alt=":D" title="Very Happy" /></div>

				<div class="content">Zigg it wont matter what anyone thinks. It has already turned into an almost clone of the way ej runs xenimus. They will always be right and the players will be wrong. Clearly me and you and sam actually get the picture for the future and how &quot;brand new players&quot; will react to a extremely high loss risk game. Thadius rules will be the best it will get so i guess go with it.

				<div class="content">coming to a fair compromise is the way EJ runs xenimus? come on
<br />If this was xenimus I would've just said no bags, full gear drop and thats the end of it.
<br />I value you guys' opinions and that's why I proposed the compromise.
<br />It's clear that there are some conflicting views about the mechanics of how PV should be, which is fine.
<br />It's also fine to argue your opinions out, like everyone did. (except you, who was still stuck on page 1 ideas on page 4)
<br />What's also fine is coming to a compromise where all reasonable parties agree.
<br />
<br />What's not fine is coming here with your bad attitude trying to ruin our game. This isn't xenimus, We are not EJ, nor are we anything like him.
<br />I KNOW how new players will react to an extremely high risk game because I've BEEN THERE, DONE THAT. And here I am 7 years later, still here!
<br />
<br />
<br />I really do want to hear what you guys think, even if it does go a different direction that our first vision of PV.
<br />If I said anything rude, I apoligize. Blue Tiger I would like you to stay and voice your opinion more often, if you can do it without the attitude, please.</div>

				<div class="content">Blue Tiger:  you can make a big difference here if you explain your opinions in a well-thought-out manner and don't just give up because someone doesn't like what you have to say.  I'm the one who (at least for now) will actually be coding all of this stuff into the game and I'm pretty neutral about these issues.  There's nothing to say that what we start out with regarding PVP, items and bags will be set in stone, either.
<br />
<br />Furthermore, simply because you can't figure out how to *defend* your opinion as well as offer it doesn't mean you have any right to project the stigma of &quot;the way ej runs xenimus&quot; onto this project.  Personally, I agree that losing gear sucks and I would prefer to have a method in place that manages to both be fun AND not allow gear loss but you have yet to present a way to do this.
<br />
<br />Now, in an effort to move FORWARD for once:  Losing gear is harsh.  Here is a NEW idea!  What about a &quot;spirit&quot; system, where when you die a transparent clone of yourself rises, equipped with the one item you dropped where you died (you keep the rest), and you have to fight yourself to get it back?  No other person would be able to kill your spirit.  Your spirit may not even have to spawn where you died, it could be in a &quot;land of the dead&quot; or something so that it's away from other players/monsters...
<br />
<br />This post should be about IDEAS not about laying down the final way the game will work.  That's pointless.</div>

<br />
<br />i think that could happen in any case. with or without bags.
<br />
<br />if one person has 'the best' gear.. how often do you think he/she will die?
<br />if they can kill nearly everyone they/he/she will begin to horde good items and be super rich.
<br />and its happening on xenimus (with bags) 
<br />
<br />Karl im not sure i like the spirit thing, sounds like WoW... but im not sure i understand what your saying fully. what happens if you lose against yourself? who gets your item? if you win do you get everything back? whats a pker supposed to do while u fight yourself?</div>

<br />
<br />Xenimus as it now is easier than it used to be, i agree with Vitriol on that. EJ has <span style="text-decoration: underline">greatly</span> Reduced the amout of exp loss, made exp loss random (sometimes u lose exp sometimes u dont), made gear less likely to drop when you die. he did these things because people wanted it. Im not so concerned with losing gear because i did something dumb. i dont want to lose gear to some high level pker. if they are inrange where i have a chance of killing the attacker and i lose, they should get a <span style="text-decoration: underline">small</span> reward not all of my gear.
<br /> 
<br />you also have to keep inmind that people on x3 are NOT noobs. they have not just started xenimus.
<br />
<br />I believe the reason why no one on xenimus got to level 30 untill a year and a half after its 1st reslease was the introduction of x2. x2 was a breeze compared to x1.
<br />
<br />i dont play WoW either, my sister in-law does. when i see her die she is in some type of spirit relm and monsters dont kill her, she has to get her body back.</div>
