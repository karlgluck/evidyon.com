				<div class="content">yeah the game wasnt that bad pre tbc, and then they decided they wanted to make cash <img src="images/smilies/icon_biggrin.gif" alt=":D" title="Very Happy" /> <br /><br />but yeah you could probably steal some ideas.<br />What i thought blizzard really knew alot of was dungeons!<br /><br />diablo they had those crypts etc which you had to go into with monsters bosses etc, wow has huge dungeons with several bosses, and you should see the mmorpg named Mythos made by flagship studios it is a mix between the two and its a fucking awsome mmorpg, but it got put on hold.</div>

				<div class="content">Speaking of dungeons. I played an mmo call Rappelz by a company called gpotato. They had a really good dungeon concept. I never played WoW for long due to my shitty as budget computer, and the 15 a month thing got old. As did buying time for, Xen. But anyways. The dungeon system may be almost the same as WoW im not sure. But the basic concept was that there were uber strong monster who had relatively low levels for their stats. This I'm guessing was because there was a level  experience ratio type sort of deal. I cant really explain it. But ANYWAYS. There were the normal mobs like that running around, but there would also be like 2 minor boss mobs for lower level dungeon partys, and there were 1 or 2 higher level boss mobs for higher level partys. But I'm just rambling on now. Basically it would be cool if there were big dungeons requiring partys of different classes in order to successfully master the dungeons. Clerics healing, tanks taking damage, DDs drilling the piss out of em, mages fucking them up from the distance, and all that good stuff. Dungeon partys just were the poo. Hands down.</div>

				<div class="content">Balanced parties are the way of the game now-adays my friend.  WoW was far from the 1st game to integrate this concept.  But going off of what you said - I do really hope that is where this game heads.  I have some crazy ideas that I have been coming up with lately that I will be sharing with Karl.  Some of them are based on previous games and others are (I'm nearly 100% certain) entirely new concepts based out of other fantasy lore.  Granted, some of them are fairly complex, but I think we might be able to come up with a nice blend.</div>

				<div class="content">New is always nice. And yeah, I didn't think WoW was the first. Just a good example. But new would be very nice. I find most MMO's these days to be really redundant.</div>
