				<div class="content">can we have health mana bars easier to see? way down in the corner kinda sucks sometimes. you dont notice it right away. and durring pvp i have to keep a steady eye on my health/mana and not on what im acctually doing. would we beable to make health mana bars like this?

				<div class="content">They seem very very large. Its a partial screen shot so i know thats contributing to it, but if they were smaller then maybe. There's all sorts of ideas though. Im sure we can put in some really good gui features in PV. Voids hp/mp bars in xenhook were really nice (the ones on the bottom of the screen.) And im sure we could have like a pots bar that we can display some info on how many pots we have remaining in our inventory. But there's still a lot more things that need to be done before we start doing this kind of thing. But im sure as soon as the main game it self is complete, such as actually having hp/mp/stats system/exp/npc's and having hit detection or whatever then this stuff is a snap to add in.</div>
