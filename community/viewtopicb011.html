				<div class="content">The other thread is piling up and is getting difficult to read.  I'm going to try and keep this one updated and informative.  I tried to find all the gliches not responded to or fixed yet.  If I missed anything please post so I can update.<br /><br /><span style="font-weight: bold">If you would like to post more information about a specific glich or bug you can click on the original Reporter's name, and update the original thread.</span><br /><br /><span style="font-weight: bold"><span style="font-size: 150%; line-height: 116%;">Gliches</span></span><br /><br /><img src="images/smilies/icon_exclaim.gif" alt=":!:" title="Exclamation" />Warriors lose HP when increasing important stats. Reported <a href="../../www.unseenstudios.com/community/viewtopic0fdf.html" class="postlink">here.</a><br />Reported by Ven- @ lvl 15 had 452 HP @lvl 16 +1 con 451 HP<br />Reported by LEXIC- @ +1 Agil lost 10 HP<br /><img src="images/smilies/icon_arrow.gif" alt=":arrow:" title="Arrow" />Karl's Theory is that HP adjusting gear is not being recalculated.  If you experience this problem, try removing your gear and putting it back on.  Reguardless of wether or not this fixes the problem please post the results.<br /><br /><img src="images/smilies/icon_exclaim.gif" alt=":!:" title="Exclamation" />Client Crashing<br /><img src="images/smilies/icon_arrow.gif" alt=":arrow:" title="Arrow" /> If you have frequent crashing in specific areas please post here so Karl can look for similarities.<br /><img src="images/smilies/icon_arrow.gif" alt=":arrow:" title="Arrow" /> Client Crashing is when the server is still running but your computer stops running the game.  It can sometimes be cause by your own hardware and if no one else is experiencing Client Crashes (read around here to find out) you may be running too many programs at once.<br /><br /><img src="images/smilies/icon_exclaim.gif" alt=":!:" title="Exclamation" />Server Crashing<br /><img src="images/smilies/icon_arrow.gif" alt=":arrow:" title="Arrow" /> If the server crashes and you are the first to the forum please update one of the server crash threads so that Karl can get it up and running.<br /><br /><img src="images/smilies/icon_exclaim.gif" alt=":!:" title="Exclamation" />Lightning Orb and a Holy wand equiped. These two items and the base mp regen of the character should add up to be +137 regen. However in the display, it shows &quot;+-119&quot;. However, judging from the mp bar, I would say it actually is recharging at a rate of +137, so it must be just a display problem in the stats screen. Reported by <a href="http://www.unseenstudios.com/community/viewtopic.php?f=29&amp;t=2914" class="postlink">Glorifindelus</a><br /><br /><img src="images/smilies/icon_exclaim.gif" alt=":!:" title="Exclamation" />Multiple Adepts (Possibly includes Sorcerer's too) using magic can freeze gameplay. Reported by <a href="viewtopicdf06.html" class="postlink">Part-time Modeler</a><br /><img src="images/smilies/icon_arrow.gif" alt=":arrow:" title="Arrow" /> I'm not sure if you fixed this in 3.7 hasn't been said for certain. If Karl could confirm?<br /><br /><img src="images/smilies/icon_exclaim.gif" alt=":!:" title="Exclamation" /> Experience/Kill changes drastically when in a party. Reported by <a href="viewtopic1acf.html" class="postlink">Glorifindelus</a><br /><img src="images/smilies/icon_arrow.gif" alt=":arrow:" title="Arrow" />Maybe intentional to encourage parties?<br /><br /><span style="font-weight: bold"><span style="font-size: 150%; line-height: 116%;"><span style="text-decoration: underline">Fixed and Updated</span></span></span><br />This list will be cleared after major updates. If you have reason to believe something doesn't belong on the fixed and updated list please post.<br /><br /><img src="images/smilies/icon_exclaim.gif" alt=":!:" title="Exclamation" /> Magic attacks are imbalanced to meelee attacks. Reported Often<br /><img src="images/smilies/icon_arrow.gif" alt=":arrow:" title="Arrow" /> Once meelee attacks are asuridly where the team wants them, magic will be adjusted based on meelee. Confirmed by Erich.<br /><br /><img src="images/smilies/icon_exclaim.gif" alt=":!:" title="Exclamation" /> When Whirlwind collides with another object in game, it stops the animation, causing a 2-3 second delay in the next attack or spell.

Reported by Lexic<br /><br /><img src="images/smilies/icon_exclaim.gif" alt=":!:" title="Exclamation" />Spectral Throwing Knife is weaker than lightning, even though it has higher reqs. (I haven't actually seen lightning Throwing knives myself so I can't confirm this)  Reported by Morn<br /><img src="images/smilies/icon_arrow.gif" alt=":arrow:" title="Arrow" />Apparently Fiery, Earthen, and Holy Gloves all share the same stats.
