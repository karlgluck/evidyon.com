				<h3>Regular Progress Updates</h3>

				<div class="content">Alright, here in this topic forum where I will post semi-regularly updates on what I have accomplished for that day.<br />I will post updates here on the progress that I have made for that day, if any.  <br />I will not post information if I did not work that day.<br /><br /><span style="color: #FF0000">UPDATE 12-08-09</span>  <br />-I added a large section to the map yesterday and have started to create the spawnpoints and monster levels for that map.  It is also located in the Southern Dungeon.<br />-As far as the monster levels in South Dungeon go, I can't seem to find what is making the Golems and Liches 1 hit people.  All their levels are correct and assigned level areas are correct.<br />-I also haven't figured out why the Blue Geosid guard is 1-2 hitting people.  The files for the guard are all correct, maybe a simple re-compile may fix some of this.<br />-Oh Shupter, I modified the Acid Axe to make it's percent steal as much as the Spectral Great Axe.  I also added physical defense to the Acid Axe so that it is a little better than the Spectral Great Axe.  <br />I will re-compile the game Wednesday and see if it works, if it does, I will upload it that night.  If not by Wednesday, Thursday I only have one class and don't have work, so I will be able to do it then.<br />-Karl has also raised the level cap to 60 and has been implemented into the game.</div>

				<div class="content">Today I spent 2 hours tremendously expanding the map.  I will not say what areas I expanded but, they are completely new unexplored areas.<br />I added the walls, hunting levels, and 70 monster spawnpoints.<br />I still need to add ground textures, hunting area names, and scenery.<br /><br />The next day I will work on this map will be Wednesday.  I have class all day Tuesday.<br /><br />-Ryan</div>

				<div class="content">Most-likely not see any of these additions until further down the road.  This is to let you guys know that there is progress being made towards a new map.<br />There are several more components to add, not to mention the modifying of the actual game editor.<br />Unsure as to say an estimate release of this map but, I I can say it will be later in the month.<br /><br />Today I took a hour brake here at school and laid out a really awesome dungeon map on some graph paper.  It is about 3-times what the current dungeon now is.  At least the part that is released.<br />It consists of new grinding areas, because I know everyone is tired of trolls, I am making this map level entirely of Skeletons.  Not to worry, these are no standard Skeletons, explorer beware.<br />This will be an awesome map to explore with friends or in Marzuku's case, a dungeon raid party would be perfect for this map.  There are over 50 rooms to search and more than 3 vast areas to endure. <img src="images/smilies/icon_biggrin.gif" alt=":D" title="Very Happy" /> <br />The creating of walls (even though they are on paper right now) is just one of the nine or so components to create in order to make a map.  So just a heads up that this map will not be out for a while.  Maybe an estimate release around Christmas would be proper.  Just to allow time for exams and end-term papers.</div>

				<div class="content">Alrighty then, I have completed all map component modifications for a new addition to the current map.<br />I also implemented 1 new level of AI for a new monster level I added yesterday.<br />All together there are:<br />-3 new monster levels, (hint, you need to atleast have hoy gear to take on the least powerful monsters)<br />-a vast expansion of the current map that is being played right now.<br /><br />Also, Karl is working on a way to implement my modifications into the new hopefully full map release.<br />At minimun, if the full map is not ready to be released this weekend, there will be a release of the modifications that I made to the current release.<br />So we should definetly have something new this weekend!</div>

				<div class="content">As far as the update goes, I am finished with the map and have completed adding new monsters.<br />I am having trouble with the game editor and cannot compile my mod.  I have tried everything I can think of and really want t play the mod myself.  <br />I am waiting for Karl's response, I am at a point where there must be something that I am missing and need Karl's help.<br /><br />I will post when there is an update up or an estimated time it will be up.<br /><br />For Saturday's event, well I had planned on having the new map expension up but you already know I am having problems on it.<br />There were a steady 5 players (not including myself) on from Friday night to Saturday night.  Only one newer guy seemed interested in the giveaway so I gave him an Iron Bracelot, since there were only 5 players on.</div>

				<div class="content">Sorry I was unable to upload the new map this past weekend. <img src="images/smilies/icon_sad.gif" alt=":(" title="Sad" /> <br />I did not let the day go to waste though.  I started creating a completely new map, that will be integrated into the main game.<br />Durring the 1 1/2 hours I spent map building today; I was able to get almost all the walls done for my new map.  This is the map that I drew up on graph paper on last Tuesday, so, I am going to keep working on this map until I get Karl to give me a hand with the compiling issue.<br />Don't worry people, even though I was unable to supply a new update this past weekend, it will be made up.<br />Progress will be gained in some way shape or form!</div>

				<div class="content">A little more progress has been made.  After wading through waist deep files and tinkering I  found the last problem but now have a new one.<br />The game compiles about 85% of the way then decides it doesn't want to finish.  Like I said before, fix one thing, get a little further then have to find and fix another issue.<br />Almost there, I can smell it! (oh wait, nevermind, I think that is the smell of Turkey.)<br /><br />Anyways I think my head is about to explode, that is enough for tonight.<br />I don't have school and only have a half day at work for Wednesday, will be more updates to follow.<br /><br />One more thing, quite chompin before you need to see a dentist.  I think it is too late for Morn though.</div>

				<div class="content">Well I have figured out the problem, I think.<br />Unfortunatly it looks to be an internal problem with the game editor.  I have e-mailed Karl about it and hope to hear from him today.<br />The program starts at 29 mb memory usage then increases to 517 mb usage on my computer, no wonder the thing doesn't want to compile.<br />The more I talk about it the crazier it makes me.  I am dying just as much as you guys to play this update, possibly a little more anxious.</div>
