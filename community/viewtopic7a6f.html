That's too much though.<br />There went like 6 bone rings/4 gold rings and other random stuff. (Glad I had 6 rings on or I would of lost alot more.)</div>

				<div class="content">I dont think the server distributes spawn according to what's being killed....I think the more hunted areas are producing less spawn than less hunted areas because eventually whatever you kill appears in a rock, or gets stuck, ect. like in xenimus.....you have to find all the monsters or eventually the area's spawn will go to crap..</div>
