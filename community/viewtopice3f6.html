				<div class="content">When stuck in a wall, all spells become mute/ineffective (as well as Valtus Mederi Charms). It's getting kinda annoying and making me very angry, because I'll get stuck in a wall, enemies walk up behind blocking my way out, and I can't kill (no spells work) them nor do I have enough time to type g/home. I died, and because the charm doesn't work I get a 50k xp penalty.  <img src="images/smilies/icon_exclaim.gif" alt=":!:" title="Exclamation" />  <img src="images/smilies/icon_evil.gif" alt=":evil:" title="Evil or Very Mad" />  <img src="images/smilies/icon_exclaim.gif" alt=":!:" title="Exclamation" />  I would really appreciate if I could have the penalty removed or the xp reimbursed if I manage to work it off before Karl or Erich reads this. Also, items that are dropped when stuck in a wall vanish, if I had dropped one of my rarer items it would've been even worse. =/ I strongly suggest moving this bug close to the top of your to-do list. Thanks for taking the time to read.</div>

I don't believe I've ever been killed while stuck and wearing a V.M.C., so I couldn't speak to that.  I have had trouble recovering lost items:  they seem to be dropped in places where I can't reach them.<br /><br />Has anybody else experienced these three problems?</div>

				<div class="content">I have experienced these problems as well, only  I lost my Earthen Emblem.<br />I tried for 20 minutes clicking around in the wall to see if I could happen to walk on my pile to pick up my gear.  No luck.<br /><br />With my warrior, when stuck in a wall I can't seem to get out of, I am able to perform tornado or spin, cast reditas dorma (return to square) and I just keep spinning incase any enemies come at me.  You cannot see the creatures, nor hear their spells, but you know if you kill one of them because the gold pile (or any dropped gear) will still show up.</div>
