				<div class="content">TOday I made a noob mage and I had no idea that storage was shared on accounts lol ... so i transfered him a bunch of gear to use, and at level 11 i went on my main and gave my mage a boars mace to see any new spells next lvl... I thought hmm nothin i better keep this in my mages storage for next lvl and then I went to stor and realized that it was shared... what I also realized was that the 10 or more items above the mace in storage had vanished since i pulled it out...<br />unfortuneantly for me most of these items were of considerable use to both of my characters... I am pretty frustrated.</div>

				<div class="content">1: have you logged in &amp; out and confirmed items are gone?  Is your scroll bar all the way at the top?<br />2: Did this happen when the server crashed?<br />3: Give exact steps for what happened.  I.e.  Log on &quot;Character Name&quot;.  Open storage.  Has 20 or so items in it.  Remove first 10 items in storage.  Drop on ground.  Log off &quot;Character Name&quot;.  Log on....  etc.<br /><br />This will help me look for the bug.</div>
