				<div class="content">All high lvl's are fighters.... simple reason, they do better damage.    and have more armor/health.   Mages spell damage needs to be boosted, takes a fig about 6 spins to kill a spirit lvl 17, and a mage 15 pueaso or 10 vis puesdo to kill them.   That seems unfair.... also can int effect the spell damage?    i got a sorc with 30 intelligence, 31 in a minute here, and he still takes forever to kill spirits, who barely hurt him because running/trans (each hit actually does 1/4 his hp or so.)  which is about 562.  <br /><br />Stats 11-10-21-31-18 sorc<br />does horrible casting damage?<br />Has low health (understandable)</div>
