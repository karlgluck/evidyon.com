			<div class="content">Regarding mob placement: From my experience the spawn <span style="font-style: italic">is</span> gradually becoming harder, the more you walk north the harder the monsters get (crawlers-&gt;novice/apprentice-&gt;regulars-&gt;hard stuff). Also if you take the pathes as guideline and stroll around left and right of it a bit you're bound to find spawn (it seems to respawn quite slow though).<br />Some 'landmarks' or remarkable places would still be nice though.<br /><br />Stuff i found:<br />- Self-hitting should definetely be disabled (i accidently kill me with my combo in one hit...)<br />- Melee-Damage is a bit overpowered atm (hard to judge from my perspective though - 777hp, 38 str -&gt; kill myself in one combo)<br />- (as mentioned above) a shorter respawn-time for monsters would help<br />- Masters/experts still do tons of damage, i think around ~300 to my level 777hp-dude with 295 armor<br />- Might be good to increase the droprate if you want us to find some of the rarer stuff (it's been around one week since you said to me there are more and rarer items than just bejeweled rings, yet nothing has been found. Reducing the masters/experts strength might allready solve that though)<br /><br />Edit: The tab-thing looks intentional to me. :J</div>

			<div class="content">Thanks for the comprehensive list, Cagen.  I have responses and some questions for you:<br /><br /><blockquote><div><cite>Cagen wrote:</cite>When trying to pick up a pile of items when you have a full inventory it makes it impossible for anyone else to pick up the pile.</div></blockquote><br />What does this mean?  Do you mean you feel it's a bug that players are able to stand on a pile and &quot;guard&quot; it?  I'm just not sure what you're talking about.<br /><br /><blockquote><div><cite>Cagen wrote:</cite>Dead bodies sometimes slide across the map.</div></blockquote><br />Yup<br /><br /><blockquote><div><cite>Cagen wrote:</cite>Teleporting while running is bugged according to Karl, however I could never do it before this update and now I can. </div></blockquote><br />This has been fixed<br /><br /><blockquote><div><cite>Cagen wrote:</cite>Tab toggles the displaying of player/mob names instead of having to hold it</div></blockquote><br />Yes, I changed this<br /><br /><blockquote><div><cite>Cagen wrote:</cite>Edge of the safe square (1 tile off the square) is still attackable from but not attackable on. You can not take damage but you can deal it.</div></blockquote><br />You are able to attack from inside of the safe SQ right now.  I am debating whether to change this:  my intent was that people inside the square would be able to defend against higher-level harassing PKers without exposing themselves to harm.  I can see how it would be a problem though.  Any ideas?<br /><br /><blockquote><div><cite>Cagen wrote:</cite>The included map is the old version and not the one Karl recompiled with the fixed edges.</div></blockquote><br />This is going to be included in the next full download.  It requires distributing the big 30 MB pack, so although the map has been fixed on the server it'll have to wait for the client.<br /><br /><blockquote><div><cite>Cagen wrote:</cite>When picking up items, placement into inventory seems to be random unless your inventory is cached on the server after logging out/a set period of time.</div></blockquote><br />Would it be better if it were sorted by time last picked up?  It wouldn't be too much trouble to put the items at the top of the list.<br /><br /><blockquote><div><cite>Cagen wrote:</cite>Mobs still spawn inside mountains, haven't seen any in the water yet though it is the same bug.</div></blockquote><br />Darn, I thought I fixed that one.<br /><br /><blockquote><div><cite>Cagen wrote:</cite>Non adepts need more balancing, possibly more mp regen or more mp for caster classes while adepts are still in the game as they can't compete with no consumables.</div></blockquote><br />Adepts will be removed for 1.9; after that, I agree the classes need to be rebalanced.<br /><br /><blockquote><div><cite>Cagen wrote:</cite>Mob placement needs to be fixed, you should go from newb/easy mobs out side of the spawn and the further out you go the harder the mobs get so there is some kind of progression. Right now they seem to be placed all over the place randomly.</div></blockquote><br />There is a progression (at least, I designed one).  The center path from nexus is the easiest stuff.  Slightly harder is the left path.  The toughest stuff is past the mountains and on the right path around the lake thing.<br /><br /><blockquote><div><cite>Cagen wrote:</cite>Also I have yet to find any kind of designated area with perpetual spawn like a graveyard or a castle, it just seems to be never ending fields. However this may be me not finding anything.</div></blockquote><br />There are none yet; it's just a world with monsters<br /><br /><blockquote><div><cite>Cagen wrote:</cite>You must click after typing /respawn for the client to update the players position. </div></blockquote><br />Yes, I know.  /respawn won't be staying in the game, however.<br /><br /><blockquote><div><cite>Cagen wrote:</cite>Having the damage reflect off characters on the square means you can not pvp/pk anywhere near the square on the mage type, at least not on a wiz when our best spell is an aoe, as it justs kills us instantly. Square hoppers use this to their advantage.</div></blockquote><br />The solution here is...not to use AOEs near the square.  I will be balancing the classes so that your best PvP spell shouldn't be an AOE anyway.<br /><br /><blockquote><div><cite>Cagen wrote:</cite>Updater should tell the user they have the most up to date client if this is true.</div></blockquote><br />Good point</div>

			<div class="content">About the first thing, the inventory-full-items-stay thing:<br />I might have experienced that too, thought it was a graphical issue. When your inventory is full and you try to pick up stuff it sort of gets 'marked' and then no other chars can pick it up, it just stays on the ground (I think that's it. Personally i thought though it was just a graphical error because of too many items in one spot...didn't check if there were actually really items still on the ground).<br /><br />I really like the idea of having items placed in pick-up order in the inventory, makes hunting for items much easier (for dropping junk you just need to scroll down to the latest pick-ups then).<br /><br />As for the sq, i would say just remove the ability to be able to do damage while standing on it. But more importantly, the edges should be clear so that you can't stay allready on dirt-tiles but still be technically 'on sq' (confusing and it allready gets 'abused' lulz).</div>

			<div class="content"><span style="font-size: 93%; line-height: 116%;">This new information confirmed by Karl's replies, <br /><br />This has been updated via the most up to date thread of Karls to do list. This is yet to be amended by Karl though from the recent update <img src="./images/smilies/icon_razz.gif" alt=":P" title="Razz" /><br /><br />Also Cagen, some of the information you have asked Karl to change and reported is in some cases an already known problem, and I presume Karl would be aware of this from the updated thread I provide to him. If you need a link this will be the topic below for future reference it is:<br /><br /><a href="http://www.unseenstudios.com/community/viewtopic.php?f=26&amp;t=1062" class="postlink">http://www.unseenstudios.com/community/viewtopic.php?f=26&amp;t=1062</a><br /><br /><br />And in response to the below,<br /><br /><blockquote><div><cite>Karl G. wrote:</cite>Thanks for the comprehensive list, Cagen.  I have responses and some questions for you:<br /><br /><blockquote><div><cite>Cagen wrote:</cite>Edge of the safe square (1 tile off the square) is still attackable from but not attackable on.

So in effect becomes vulnerable. That is my idea with this question in mind! <img src="./images/smilies/icon_biggrin.gif" alt=":D" title="Very Happy" /><br /><br /><br /><br />All the Best,<br />Richard</span></div>

			<div class="content">I just collated the bugs in this updated and ones carried over from the last, so the ones you know about were just here for other people to see they had already been noted. I didn't realise there was an official bugs post that some of these were already in, I'll check next time and only post ones that aren't already in it.<br /><br /><blockquote><div><cite>Karl G. wrote:</cite>Thanks for the comprehensive list, Cagen.  I have responses and some questions for you:<br /><br /><blockquote><div><cite>Cagen wrote:</cite>When trying to pick up a pile of items when you have a full inventory it makes it impossible for anyone else to pick up the pile.</div></blockquote><br />What does this mean?  Do you mean you feel it's a bug that players are able to stand on a pile and &quot;guard&quot; it?  I'm just not sure what you're talking about.<br /><span style="font-weight: bold"><br />Ok, earlier I dropped a pile of items around 10 from my main character and tried to pick them up with one of my storage characters on another account, both of which were logged in at the same time. My storage character picked up 2 of the items but then his inventory was full, I then went back to my main character to pick up the items but I was unable to do so. Like Sankt said, it seems to mark the items as not being there anymore (as they should be in the storage characters inventory) however they are still on the ground. </span><br /><br /><blockquote><div><cite>Cagen wrote:</cite>Edge of the safe square (1 tile off the square) is still attackable from but not attackable on. You can not take damage but you can deal it.</div></blockquote><br />You are able to attack from inside of the safe SQ right now.  I am debating whether to change this:  my intent was that people inside the square would be able to defend against higher-level harassing PKers without exposing themselves to harm.  I can see how it would be a problem though.  Any ideas?<br /><span style="font-weight: bold"><br />While Xen had this implemented it was amusing to kill people from the square though highly unfair and removing it was completely justified. In my opinion you should not be able to be attacked or attack from the square while stood on it. To combat square jumping a bit, there should be a system that if you attack someone without killing them (you are the aggressor) and jump to the safety square it will have no effect for you for <span style="font-style: italic">X time period</span>, however if you are attacked by someone and jump to the square it will act as the safety square should and defend you. This could go into more depth by making the safety square have no effect for <span style="font-style: italic">X time period</span> if you aren't the aggressor but stay in battle for <span style="font-style: italic">X time period</span>. This makes it a little more fair for the aggressor as the other person wont be able to fight for a while and as soon as they start to lose or get low on consumables just jump straight to the safety square. </span><br /><br /><blockquote><div><cite>Cagen wrote:</cite>When picking up items, placement into inventory seems to be random unless your inventory is cached on the server after logging out/a set period of time.</div></blockquote><br />Would it be better if it were sorted by time last picked up?  It wouldn't be too much trouble to put the items at the top of the list.<br /><span style="font-weight: bold"><br />Items you pick up should go at the end of you inventory list, after items you were already holding.</span><br /><br /><blockquote><div><cite>Cagen wrote:</cite>Non adepts need more balancing, possibly more mp regen or more mp for caster classes while adepts are still in the game as they can't compete with no consumables.</div></blockquote><br />Adepts will be removed for 1.9; after that, I agree the classes need to be rebalanced.<br /><br /><span style="font-weight: bold">Can we have an official statement on what will be happening to adepts and/or normal characters? You said to sankt and I that they will be replaced with normal classes, I assume of equal level, at random.</span><br /><br /><blockquote><div><cite>Cagen wrote:</cite>Mob placement needs to be fixed, you should go from newb/easy mobs out side of the spawn and the further out you go the harder the mobs get so there is some kind of progression. Right now they seem to be placed all over the place randomly.</div></blockquote><br />There is a progression (at least, I designed one).  The center path from nexus is the easiest stuff.  Slightly harder is the left path.  The toughest stuff is past the mountains and on the right path around the lake thing.<br /><span style="font-weight: bold"><br />There is some progression of easier from the spawn radiating out, the problem I have with it is that there are apprentice and novice all over the place and only small pockets of the mobs with no prefix, the masters and experts are plenty as not many people can hunt them.<br /><br />Example: Nightcrawlers &gt; novice/apprentice &gt; no prefix &gt; novice/apprentice &gt; masters/novice/apprentice/no prefix &gt; expert<br /></span><br /></div></blockquote></div>

			<div class="content">Hehe, ages of mapping experience made me a good bug catcher i guess. ^_^<br /><br />Another one i didn't see being mentioned: <br />When you level up, HP/MP jumps to the new bases instantly. Let's say you have 700HP and 60MP, you kill a mob, get the level up and the same second your HP/MP jumps to the new base HP/MP, maybe 200/15 in this case. Result is a gruesome death. :p<br /><br />Edit: I'm just guessing it's the new bases here, because my HP/MP gets really low after a level-up, i think it would match.</div>

			<div class="content">I believe this has been reported before. But its never happened to me. Now it has.<br />Was just killing some monsters and picking up the drops. Went into the inventory and got this when i scrolled over a couple of items. I took this print screen, closed out went and killed something else and picked up its drops, then checked my inventory again and it wasnt doing it.<br /><br />Sorry about breaking the tables. We need the spoiler box so we can hide the pics.</div>
