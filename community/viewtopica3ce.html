				<div class="content"><span style="font-weight: bold">All items moved to/from storage are deleted</span>.  The game seems to think they're all duped.<br /><br />It's not that you can't raise a stat past 18, it's that the game makes you assign 25 points before you can raise past 18--just as if you were creating your character all over again.  The first 25 points are the points you get when you create a character, and then the rest of the points are from lvls.<br /><br />I'll update the list.</div>

				<div class="content">I'm not sure, but I'll bet it had to do with moving them to/from storage--there were some weird problems like that with the whole item system, which it was the purpose of this update to fix.  That shouldn't happen anymore, and the current problem with storage is going to be fixed Monday, so hopefully this will be the last we have to mess with the item system for a long long time. <img src="images/smilies/icon_neutral.gif" alt=":|" title="Neutral" /></div>

				<div class="content">So I was grinding some trolls and got killed. Well right before i died i recalled, and obviously when i did it i was already dead or something to that extent. Well all the gear i had equipped i lost. So when i went back to where i had recalled to when i died i found my gear, but somehow i found everything i had except an aurelian plate and a sp sword. It just went poof. Is that supposed to happen?</div>
