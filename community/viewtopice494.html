				<div class="content">When I open the Evidyon logon screen, my graphics card jumps up 14c.  However, gameplay returns my GPU back to normal temps. I'm not sure if this is a bug or not, but it seems unusual to me. I would think that gameplay would stress my card and not the logon screen.</div>

				<div class="content">It does this on my laptop as well.<br /><br />The jump in stress happens in the login screen and when it says &quot;Stop trying to connect&quot;.   The character creation screen and game-play are both unaffected.  <br /><br />My laptop and desktop are two drastically different machines.  The desktop runs a 64 bit Vista with a Quadcore, 1gb GPU 675 core clock....the works.<br />My laptop runs a very basic 32bit XP with integrated Intel graphics.  <br /><br />I installed the Direct X provided by your setup in order the fix the DLL issue on both machines.<br /><br />Whenever I click &quot;enter world&quot; yet remain on the login screen, the temps go down.  So....as I try and access the world, I'm unaffected.<br /><br />Anyways, not a crippling bug, but unusual.</div>

				<div class="content">my videocard has a fan that will spin up the hotter it gets. The fan is in need of replacement (im going to get a new card and give this one to my partner), the fan does scream. When the login screen comes up, the fan screams like crazy. Logging in, it goes away.</div>

				<div class="content">OH!!!1<br /><br />I figured out the problem you guys are having--the renderer's speed isn't capped during the login process. I thought it was superfluous.  Could you make a post in &quot;feature requests&quot; for a &quot;FPS cap during all screens&quot;?</div>
