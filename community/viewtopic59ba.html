				<h3>Tales from the Coding Cave</h3>

				<div class="content">After a very nauseating flight home (ever ride a 30-seat propeller plane through an ice storm?) I have been coding like crazy, which is why I haven't been posting here <img src="images/smilies/icon_smile.gif" alt=":)" title="Smile" /><br /><br />I believe I am on track for an early-January pre-beta release.  And not just in the hackity hack super hackjob way that I did before!    Old system:  4 enchantments, no support for dispelling enchantments, 16 bytes PER CHARACTER to display enchantments.  New system:  2 bytes per character, 8 simultaneous enchantments of about 27 unique types, plus support for invisible enchantments like Almus, poisoning and Nocte Visus.<br /><br />As of this morning, the enchantment system is implemented and I have tested a Velocitas-like spell (including a nifty special effect!)<br /><br />I'm going to add some more cool special effects, then I'll show some new screenies.<br /><br /><br />A side-note of something cool I found:  a &quot;curing&quot; spell is just an enchantment of the &quot;poison&quot; type that deals 0 damage and lasts for 0 seconds.  Nifty!</div>

				<div class="content">If you remember, a little while back I mentioned that the next update would include multiple maps.<br /><br />Today, I'm implementing that feature.  It's not quite as difficult as I had imagined, and it actually led very nicely to a few new features:<ul><li>Transporting between maps requires some sort of &quot;special&quot; map tile, so I implemented that</li><li>These special map tiles don't just have to teleport you: they can also do cooler stuff!  They can be triggers for special enchantment effects, shrines, traps and more--even some stuff Xen never had.  For example, shrines that give you a really powerful enchantment but only work once every few hours...or only work when you've triggered other things in the game</li><li>Different maps need different atmospheres.  I'll be working on implementing a day/night/weather system.  I've done this before, so when I start it shouldn't take too long.</li><li>Also, music.  I have done this before, too.</li></ul><br />I haven't released any screenies yet because I haven't quite had enough time between coding new features to add stuff that's shiny and fun-looking.  Plus, the monsters aren't back in the game yet <img src="images/smilies/icon_sad.gif" alt=":(" title="Sad" />  My priority is to (1) finish this mapping stuff this afternoon then (2) get those monsters back.  I'll do a demo video + screenshots at that point, and make a couple of small maps showing off the new features.  After that, I think its REALLY time for me to get the kickass physical combat engine integrated.  Finally, I'll add in items again.  At that point, it'll be pre-beta!<br /><br />It's on the horizon, you guys!!!  Almost there!!!!!!</div>

				<div class="content">Maps are finally finished and debugged!  You can now move between any number of different maps <img src="images/smilies/icon_biggrin.gif" alt=":D" title="Very Happy" />  To test things out, I made a simple cave.<br /><br />Next up: baddies!  I've got a couple of new friends for you guys that might be fun, too <img src="images/smilies/icon_biggrin.gif" alt=":D" title="Very Happy" /><br /><br /><br /><br />oh, also! a new melee skill I thought up that might be cool: deflecting arrows with a spin attack.  would need some balancing but I'd love to implement it.</div>
