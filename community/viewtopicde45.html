				<div class="content">sorcs should have pretty much minimum Health.. but should still have Great defense, or reflect dmg, or maybe even repel (doubts this will be put into play), hell maybe even all of these..<br /><br />but with all of them, if the sorc is de-spelled, their 100% screwed ;D<br /><br />but yes.. If egg isn't implemented sometime soon, people may die in vain.. ;D</div>
