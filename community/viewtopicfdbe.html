				<div class="content">things have slowed down recently thanks to the last couple weeks of classes and exams, but will be speeding up by a *lot* starting next week.<br /><br />there will be an item update soon (I believe it will be next week), and after that you'll be seeing a lot of new features spring up quickly, and although a serious content expansion may wait until Beta, that won't be long coming (sometime in June) and we'll try to regularly add at least a little content in the meantime.<br /><br />Sourceofprovidence, my last serious exam is Thursday morning.  After that I should be on for a little bit every day, usually in the evenings (Central time).  I'll make a point to be online for several hours (at least standing around on Sq) this Thursday evening so that I can restore your gear.  Sorry it's taken this long--in the future if there are problems that remain unaddressed feel free to send me a PM and I'll make sure to make time.</div>
