				<div class="content">...when one thread just isn't enough? :p<br /><br />Anyways, i add mine here too:<br />- Second camera has a pretty weird viewing angle (like if the first view got rotated by 120-180 degrees) and it seems to change slightly depending on where you have the mouse cursor when changing the viewpoint (not 100% sure about the second part...just seems to me like it)<br /><br />Edit: Btw karl, that was the reason i asked you yesterday if you changed the map. ^^</div>

				<div class="content">I agree about the classic camera, the perfect distance for me was in the previous version (lot more zoomed out).<br />And maybe it seems more zoomed in than in xen because the models differ in size (allthough tiles look larger to me too). o0<br /><br />Edit: Actually you're right karl, the tiles look exactly like in xen considering distance. I bet it's the different sized models. :J<br /><br />EditÂ²: And the second camera mode definetely changes it's viewing angle everytime i choose it. :s</div>

Anyway the camera is the same distance as Xen's however Xen's models are slightly smaller then Ev's. I prefered the further zoomed out camera to the close up one of Xen. Maybe add another camera mode to zoom it out and have the close up as default.<br /><br />Going to get started on spell usage/mp costs tonight as I probably have the most viable character to test with out of everyone. That's going to be a fun slog <img src="images/smilies/icon_sad.gif" alt=":(" title="Sad" /> lol.</div>

				<div class="content">Couple more things.<br /><br />-Cant trans on safe zone (may be intended?)<br />-If you log in and there is another player standing where you are, you get stuck in them and are unable to get out unless you trans away (off of the safe zone) or go into gas form.<br />-Update to my previous post about pulling up the hud when in inventory and no text shows up on the hud. That is a result of the messed up text bug. It only doesnt show the words and is unresponsive when the inventory text gets all 'garbaged' up.<br />-You can open up the hud and select inventory, open the hud back up and select keys, open the hud back up and select stats, and each respective menu will open and not cancel out the rest of the menus. It seems like if you have inventory open, and open the hud back up and select another menu (stats or key) it should close out of the inventory menu and open the newly selected menu up.<br />-The scroll bar in the keys menu is difficult to grab. Actually i noticed the actual location you have to grab is further to the right of the scroll bar then the scroll bar is.<br /><br />This ones is really weird. When i move my mouse over the bottom half of my inventory screen i get this. I cant get it to go out of that either by moving my mouse back. I have to hit esc to close out of the inventory menu.<br /><!-- m --><a class="postlink" href="../../www.sgn.servegame.com/image/wtftext.jpg">http://www.sgn.servegame.com/image/wtftext.jpg</a><!-- m --></div>

				<div class="content">I noticed that when I am walking away from enemies I'll sometimes get stuck in the single enemy following me which ends up getting my slaughtered. <br /><br />Bone Staff, and other 2H staves don't seem to have a graphic from what I've noticed (this may have been posted).<br /><br />From what I hear certain items don't seem to be dropping at all, while others that didn't drop often before seem to be dropping a ton. Example being rings, Rings are plentiful at the moment to where bone cleavers and the like are extremely rare if at all found. <br /><br />This is all I've noticed so far. Keep up the good work people!</div>
