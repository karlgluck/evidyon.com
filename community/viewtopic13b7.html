				<div class="content">Interesting... I can only post new topics when I'm logged <span style="font-style: italic">out</span>.  This is Adrenum...<br /><br />I have created a few characters and played around in-game, but am now getting a Stop error (Blue screen.)  It occurs only after I have clicked the &quot;Enter game&quot; button, never before, but is unpredictable in-game.  I created a new character to test the error and was able to get across the town square before it crashed.  Sometime it crashes right after I hit &quot;Enter game.&quot;  It might just be a graphics card issue (nv4_disp.dll = nvidia display) but I have no idea =/<br /><br />Anyone one else encounter similar errors?<br /><br />(link: <!-- m --><a class="postlink" href="../../i39.tinypic.com/34oc4di.jpg">http://i39.tinypic.com/34oc4di.jpg</a><!-- m -->) - sorry for using tinypic by the way, but meh<br /><img src="../../i39.tinypic.com/34oc4di.jpg" alt="Image" /><br /><br /><br />~Adrenum</div>

				<div class="content">Ah yes the good ol' blue screen of death. Many of us Nvidia users have it unfortunately, and Karl is trying to fix it as much as he can... I can imagine it being very hard to fix(especially when he can't replicate it on his own computers). I don't think there's much you can do about the blue screen really... some people were saying different resolutions and all that helped but I didn't really notice a difference.</div>
