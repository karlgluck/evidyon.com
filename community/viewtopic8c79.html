				<div class="content">Well i have a more specific explanation of this bug.<br /><br />Well some of you have probably noticed, that if you press putesco in  a spam manner, you will get locked in a position where you are inn the hands of monsters.<br /><br />Think it is because the game thinks it &quot;HAS&quot; to complete your cast sequence before going on to other actions, so if karl reads this, he should make it so that spells override eachother, so that if you are f.ex doing ignis multi you can Trans in the middle of the spell to another position and the ignis will cease to be casting, this is an important aspect of the &quot;Fast pace pvp&quot; which Ej had.<br /><br />Also, make it so that when you whirlwind and spam the button you reWW within a certain amount if time not surpassing seconds though.<br />BUT if you are to use a green pot while spinning a green pot will have global cooldown for about 1 second since you (just swallowed a whole bottle of green liquid)<br /><br />These are things you can work on later on when the slaughter begins.<br /><br />BTW What captures the most players of mmo's are the Huge weapons and Shiny awsome armors, we all know that if there werent any weapons around we would all just play along with our own pogo stick, so just make that happen some where in between Alpha Beta and so on.</div>

				<div class="content">Ok, I think the problem is that I'm only using two timers at the moment.   With more feedback as we move toward beta, I'll be able to redesign the feel a bit more easily.<br /><br />* Inconsistent item-name capitalization<br />Yeah, that's my bad &gt;.&lt; I was going to caps all Aurelian stuff, then I got distracted.  I don't know if I like it capitalized anyway.<br /><br />* There seems to be some problem with duping in storage, perhaps related to the update process: at last update Marzuku had a Spirit Sword in storage and then had two; this update seems to have duped an Aurelian Sword for me (and maybe an Aurelian Mace as well).<br />Is this just during updates, or are you able to actively dupe an item?  It's really unlikely that an item could be duped in storage because they all have unique identifiers.  If an item were to duplicate, the database would reject it.<br /><br /><br />* Clearing out my key-bindings, for one spell I had to try three times--the first two times when I right-clicked and pressed DEL the key was not un-bound, but rather re-bound, first to SEMICOLON and then to APOSTROPHE. Haven't tested this any to see if it's a particular spell or whatever, but wanted to make note of it.<br />OK, so I guess key bindings are still a little mucked up.  I'll look into it.</div>

				<div class="content">I really have no idea how the duping happened, nor how it could be replicated.  It could of course be an oversight on our part--not realizing we had multiples of an item--but I wanted to mention it just in case anybody else had seen it or we see it again.  Probably nothing to worry about until we see more of it.<br /><br />As for the key-binding, I'll mess with it some more, but it's worked very well except for that one error:  you can probably leave it alone till later if you've got more pressing things to take care of.</div>

				<div class="content">Vapore:  I don't think so.<br /><br />Finally updated this.  Will keep it more up-to-date in the future.  I want to have it ready for 2.10.  I cleaned out a lot of the old bugs about which I wasn't sure if they were still around.  Updated with other stuff, including (but not limited to):<br /><br />* Possible duping bug related to storage.<br />* Knights' velo spell still lasts only a very very short time.<br />* WIS doesn't seem to affect the strength of defensive spells:  I get +15 defense on both my casters, one with a 17 WIS, the other with a 26.<br /><br />I think there are a couple more which I've noticed, but those are the only ones I can bring to mind at the moment.</div>
