				<div class="content">The idea came when talking of making a monument for the Alpha testers instead of a tombstone(which sounded boring).<br /><br />To Quote Rapey, Xlpicit: <br /><br />Imagine 3 years from now when players go do this quest and can actually see back into the past how the game used to look like.<br />The new players would be wearing flashy armors and sick looking weapons and figthing &quot;The Alpha Testers&quot; known as &quot;The Ancients&quot; Wearing aurelian armors spirit dragon axes, wands of starlight etc.<br /><br />and i thought, how awsome isnt that? creating a quest and a monument at the same time, and providing insight in what the game used to look like, also we would be remembered forever.<br /><br />Now the Quest:<br /><br />Questline: Facing the Ancients<br /><br />In the begining there was only darkness and chaos, then there was Geona.<br />Geona supported several life forms, some cruel and malicious, some good and righteous but there was still chaos.<br />There were few who would oppose chaos, These few were named the Ancients, they were called so because they were the first of their kind, the first Heroes to explore Geona and fight of chaos for the good of the land.<br />Chaos however grew stronger, and as Chaos grew, the Ancients weakened by it's overwhelming force.<br />Wielding weapons forged by flames from chaos itself, one by one the Ancients turned and became the very thing they had opposed, and the world once again grew dark.<br /><br />Young Knight/sorceror/Class<br />Would you let an old man see the light once again before he wanders into the next path of life?<br /><br />Put to rest the men once known as &quot;The Ancients&quot;<br /><br />And what the new players would have to do is enter some kind of catacomb where there was a room filled with Alpha player copies as skeletons, wearing aurelian plates, spirit D axe, skull swords, wierd helmets, and one after one beat them in combat, each would have a different playstyle and attack style according to class.<br /><br />now that would be an awsome quest, like lvl 15-20 quest.</div>

Warriors from the early age of Evidyon battle those of the New age, thats just any genre and awsome, its like on Naruto when you saw the first and the second hokage battle the third. (An epic Battle which you wont forget.)<br /><br />anyway in that series &quot;Naruto&quot; two Great ninja leaders are revived by a forbidden technique/spell and the New ninja leader has to battle his old masters whom are wearing old armors etc, just an epic battle.<br /><br />Besides the battle is meant to kinda show development in the game aswell <img src="./images/smilies/icon_biggrin.gif" alt=":D" title="Very Happy" /></div>

				<div class="content">imagine that you were told to go lay to rest the ancients(you dont know their names) then when you come to the catacomb where they &quot;lie&quot; they are awaken in form of skeletons in their former armor, Chaos supousedly gained them long lasting life but as corrupted beings with memory.<br /><br />Suddenly they speak:<br />Solomon says:&quot;It is rude to not tell your enemy whom he is about to do battle with, what is your name young one?&quot;(hinting you will fight them)<br />you write your character name &quot;Johnny&quot;(if you dont do this they become more powerfull, hit harder cause you made them angry by deny of their request)<br /><br />Solomon says: &quot;It would be rude of us aswell not to present ourselves&quot;<br />(each of the skeletons say their name)<br />Maximus Macigos IV &quot;The Dragon Slayer&quot;<br />Solomon &quot;The wize&quot;<br />Joseph &quot;The chaotic&quot;<br />King Karl &quot;Former king of Geona&quot; (he doesnt say his name solomon does, but his nick is held a secret)<br /><br />Then they suddenly attack you all but King Karl.<br /><br />King Karl though just seems like hes looking at the battle and being entertained, You slay the 3 others after an intense battle.<br /><br />King Karl speaks &quot;Interesting young one&quot; He does some spell and you suddenly lay on the floor dying(part of the quest) <br />King Karl &quot;You are centuries ahead of being able to challenge me young one, We will meet again when you have grown stronger, remember my name King Karl The Skeleton King&quot;<br />You die and end up on Sq with all the gear you had &quot;but you completed the quest and get a reward for atleast killing the 3&quot; some Skeleton sword/armor/ring<br /><br />King Karl you see again when you become high lvl and get the quest &quot;Slay the Skeleton King&quot; like lvl 50 or whatever, kinda like the spider on Xen, which is when King Karl shows his true power and becomes huge with red eyes etc.<br /><br />this quest should be post beta though and later on when people are like lvl 30.</div>

				<div class="content">I had never thought of taking the statue idea in putting such a high level of practicality behind it, quest it up, and have it actually reflect the past and present of Evidyon. It sounds very interesting, and nothing short of entertaining. <br /><br /><blockquote><div><cite>Rabit561 wrote:</cite>I don't think Evidyon needs a storyline..<br /><br />Did xen even have a storyline?</div></blockquote><br /><br />I think the original story behind Xenimus is still up on the site.
