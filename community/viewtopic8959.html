				<div class="content">Well has of obtaining the temporary level cap at the moment I thought I'd take the time to discuss what I think about the warrior class. I find that the warrior class is good and I like how Fury/Wrath/Rage system works, but there are some problems with it later in levels as well as some other things that can be improved upon or added.<br /><br />First off, when in the higher levels and in PvP Rage doesn't seem to cut it for life steal. I think Rage's percentage, if you would, should be incremented just a little bit to help compensate for the health loss. <br /><br />Next I would just like to see an increase in the damage of Whirlwind for the later levels. This just has to be a moderate increase and nothing drastic. I know this was suggested by another player.<br /><br />Next, I think that strength and agility are not actually scaling like they're supposed to. Case in point, when I went from 25 to 26 agility I noticed a loss in attack speed, this also goes for strength as well. I noticed that my melee damage barely seems to go up, and its only goes up because of a new weapon. I don't know if the damage increase is intended to be small or not.<br /><br />Next I would like to see a new spell for the warrior that they would get at 30 - 32 or so. I think having a single target melee attack would be nice. This melee attack could attack for an X amount of melee damage times the amount of strength the player has so it has high damage, but at the cost of losing health or all of their mana. Or possibly there could be passive spells that warriors get. These spells would be along the lines of chance of hits with melee weapons or chance on getting hit type of spells. A type of chance on hit spell could be a certain % chance to increase attack speed, melee damage, etc. and a chance on getting hit could be a certain % chance when getting hit to increase defense, health regen, etc. Those are some of the ideas for a new warrior spell, I hope a new gets implemented though.<br /><br />That's all I can think of as of now, I hope you do take into consideration some of the recommendations that I have made.</div>

				<div class="content">Agility aint scaling equally to other classes, shupter has 27 agility and hits as fast as my lvl 25 who has 24 agility, hes lvl 35 though.<br /><br />We mostly require a speed buff to be able to handle the same kind of mobs as casters down, and im pretty much betting the caster agility overall is low.</div>
