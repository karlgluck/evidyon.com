				<div class="content">I have been doing the soundscape/adr ( voice dubbing) for a short film and have gone over 60 hours no sleep and several 20 hour days. I actually got some sleep the over night but just pulled another all nighter last night so it's been fucking horrid. I was so delirious my thoughts were actually in protools. Every real world sound I would see in waveform in my head and be adjusting the levels, tones and reverb. My eyes are blood shot red and have broken out in a horrid rash. NONE the less I am not looking for sympathy more so giving it. Sound in a film is an invisible art if you do a good job nobody will ever notice it <img src="images/smilies/icon_sad.gif" alt=":(" title="Sad" />. You get no praise or &quot;well done&quot;, nobody notices that it took you 3 hours to get the reverb perfect on somebody's voice in a particular room. I can't possibly imagine how much invisible poo you guys do which nobody (except another game developer) will ever take notice of. You may never get praise or encouragement and only notice the annoying slander about pointless aspects of the game but keep at it guys everything will come together and it's these unnoticed efforts which go most rewarded. Speaking of I'm not sure how game sound works exactly but if you guys are interested in some help I know some great ambient bands I use for creating that mood who might be keen to compose some music for a credit. I also do alot of foley work send me a pm if your interested.</div>

				<div class="content">Wow, that means a lot actually because you're exactly right.  Most of what you actually interact with when playing the game is maybe 5-10% of the code; the rest is really really mundane but incredibly necessary stuff that if it works you'll never notice.  It took me a good two days to make it so that monsters/players turned correctly and didn't slide when walking around.  The algorithm that makes monsters able to navigate trees/walls and find their way to attack you and such also took a day or two of work.  Thanks for the encouragement =)<br /><br />I'm with Morn, though--sleep is good!</div>
