				<div class="content">I'd love to see the server status from the launcher so I don't have to open the game to see the &quot;connecting page&quot; when the servers down.    I hate having to exit and retry again and again... just my 2 cents!</div>

				<div class="content">I know xenimus for example has a website that tells the stats of the game.   I'd rather be able to see whos online or at least a number or if the servers up from the launcher.    poo a cool vista gadget could even be made if i wasnt lazy.</div>

				<div class="content">Just wondering how the servers run at the moment, is it from your own pc or a small server, and what times it's usually up, i'm from the uk so whenever i've been on here so far nobody else has been on i presume the majority of you are American.<br /><br />Also as for a suggestion at some point it may be a cool idea to eventually have some sort of raid on a town or the town, where guards dissapear and the players have to band together to kill hordes of mobs. It should be quite difficult but it should be quite fun.</div>

				<div class="content">Hi Stuie, we're renting space on a shared server right now, and though it should be up all the time, there's currently a bug in the server software which is causing it to crash pretty regularly.  We're working to resolve the problem as quickly as possible, but in the meantime it's going to be a little dicey whether or not the game will be online.<br /><br />As for your raid suggestion, we're certainly planning to (eventually) incorporate such things. <img src="images/smilies/icon_biggrin.gif" alt=":D" title="Very Happy" /></div>

				<div class="content">cool, it's just an idea stolen from final fantasy 11 really, mtheres a mode called besieged where a town is set upon by a mob of npcs, the same would be cool in a game of this style but maybe even better.</div>
