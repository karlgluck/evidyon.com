				<div class="content">Unfortunately, there is a lot left to do--however!  I am going to release a &quot;testing&quot; client next week and leave the server app running on the space you provided for me.  This will be a very limited release in which people can just walk around the (stupid) map I made, run like crazy straight through walls, objects and each other and just generally have a good time.  Hopefully it'll work for everyone <img src="./images/smilies/icon_smile.gif" alt=":)" title="Smile" />
<br />
<br />I'm thinking of taking Sunday to get this set up.  At this point, along with PV (which I commit about 25 hrs/week to) I am working ~35 hours a week and am taking a 4 credit class...so that's why I haven't made *Quite* as much progress as I'd hope, but things are definitely coming along.
<br />
<br />Just to give you an idea of what I'm mulling over in my head right now:  the resource editor needs the ability to merge different resource files together.  For example, people making maps want to put their maps into the game.  They have different resource files, both of which have (perhaps) been modified.  The editor needs to be able to take these resource files, stick them together, and deal with what happens when two resources have the same ID number.
<br />
<br />...just a taste <img src="./images/smilies/icon_razz.gif" alt=":P" title="Razz" />
<br />
<br />
<br />Anyway, once the merging stuff is done I need to add a configuration file editor, so that you can tell the client &quot;hey, use this texture for the font&quot; or &quot;try to connect to this server&quot;, and tell the server &quot;use this map&quot;.  After that, I need to finalize the object editor, then create the new map processing units.  These shouldn't be hard as I've done them before.  Once that's complete and people can make basic maps (again) I'll write a map-importing utility so that current maps can at least *mostly* be imported and their work isn't wasted.  After that, I add support for animated-mesh resources....once that's done, I add support for loading the compiled resources into the client and server, and using the data therein.  You get the idea...  :p
