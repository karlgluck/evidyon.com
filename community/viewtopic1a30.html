				<div class="content">I just read the post Draco had posted about the shrubbery giving the wearer a spell or ability that lets you transmogrify into an actual shrub. Or hide inside of it...or WHATEVER. Here's what I think;<br /><br /><br />                          Draco, I would congratulate you for coming up with the item ability idea, if we weren't in mid-conversation when you thought of it ha. Yes I really like the idea of a FEW items in gave giving the wearer an ability, but only a few, because I believe it is more for novelty and collecting, and most of the items with abilities should be rarer then most items. The Ice/Dragon lord staff on Xenimus is an example of what I'm talking about. Its just a decent staff that gives you a spell that was removed from the game, so the user can be unique from the rest. These are qualities of a good, and addictive RPG and should be implemented in the future.<br /><br />Ideas:<br /><br />   Rings that you can activate via clicking/using item, or using abilities they give.<br /><br />   They can give shields, damage shields, strength, a minion, ect ect.<br />  <br />   Quest item Weapons with spell abilities to destroy special creatures for quests (slaying the dragon or something) which otherwise is invincible. (Example: You hack n slash at superman, but nothing happens, so you talk to the barkeeper, who tells you she hates him and wants him dead, and will pay you, then hands you a cryptonite dagger to equip, and it would have a visible or non visible spell effect that damages him.)  <br /><br />   Items that can be activated for special entry. (Example: Scroll of My House) would teleport me to my house. could  make it possible for special raids and events this way, teleporting people to ADMIN only islands, for whatever purposes. On a video game I used to play they did this, calling it portal madness -- Mazes of small islands in the middle of the ocean, withportals that you'd click on to activate, and it would take you to the portal's destination ( another small island with 3 portals, different destinations) and the first people through won the event. <br /><br />     In conclusion, there are millions of different ways you can use items with abilities to make this game stretch beyond your imagination, and keep you playing for YEARS.<br /> <br />        Sincerily FryLok/BeoWulf</div>
