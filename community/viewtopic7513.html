				<div class="content">I dont log on here much anymore, things seem to have died down....<br /><br />Whats the news on where things are? <br /><br />I really enjoy your work on the map editors, they are great. But i want to see more work into the actual game. I know, it takes a lot of work to program a game, but i know that if you put off the map editors til after the game then you could easily produce a newer version of volucris.<br /><br />So where are you game beta wise with volucris?</div>

				<div class="content">Hey man,<br /><br />Sorry to take so long to reply.  I'm hard at work at school/research and because my classes have gotten a lot harder (and more time consuming) I've had to take a break.<br /><br />But there is hope!  This next week (starting Saturday) is SPRING BREAK WOO!!!  I fully intend to dedicate as much of my time as possible to working on the client &amp; server of PV, and (cross my fingers, knock on wood) hope to have a skeleton demo out by the end of the break.  I have most of the code lying around my computer, I just need to get it collected &amp; tested.<br /><br />I completely agree that the map editor is in a good state now.  However, I had to work on it a lot to make sure that I was able to add new features and change things around without messing up the way the client would interpret the data.  This way, I can constantly improve the game without having to rewrite everything to accommodate some new feature.<br /><br />Thanks for checking in!  See you in a week.<br /><br />Karl</div>
