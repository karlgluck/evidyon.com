In any case, this is the product of far too much time and lack of sleep.<br /><br />Loot found on this journey <img src="./images/smilies/icon_smile.gif" alt=":)" title="Smile" />:<br />3 Bejeweled rings<br />Bone Aegis<br />Necklace<br />Bone Shoes<br /><br />I've also found amazing spots for gear and will proly spend the whole night now killing everything there. It would be great if we could all try and explore the ??? places on the map, Karl hinted that there was one more castle like the one on the noob continent, and that there was WAY more stuff then we have already explored. Also as far as detail goes, the first continent is the most detailed, the second is somewhat detailed, and the third is a very crappy outline of what the continent actually looks like. Everything there will kill you in one shot anyway so it doesn't matter.<br /><br />PS. Karl can you tell me how accurate this is? lol<br /><br />EDIT: hahah sweeet i found the second castle. its filled with liches, magii, axemen and archers, but im not gonna reveal where it is <img src="./images/smilies/icon_razz.gif" alt=":P" title="Razz" />.</div>

				<div class="content">Unpacking the map would be...difficult.  You're welcome to try (actually I encourage it, because if you can I'd like to change the format) but I don't think doing so would be very effective.<br /><br />This map is actually quite accurate, aside from the ??? portions and some scaling.  I'm impressed!</div>

				<div class="content">It would be pretty boring to just read in the map and know where everything is... half of what makes this game fun is exploring <img src="./images/smilies/icon_smile.gif" alt=":)" title="Smile" />(well to me anyway).</div>
