				<div class="content">The lag is going to be worked on.  Possibly on Thursday at the earliest, and the 24rth of this month at the latest.<br />I do not know why the lag has started so badly, especially when chatting but, is a known issue and will be delt with.<br />The server subscription ends at the end of this month so, in order to save server fees and costs, Karl has provided me with an old computer<br />to serve as a dedicated server computer.  Once Karl has transferred the server to his computer at my house then, we will see if there is anymore lag. There shouldn't be <img src="./images/smilies/icon_biggrin.gif" alt=":D" title="Very Happy" /> <br />Once the server transfer is compete, Karl can save on server fees and use that money for something better, like time off or a little break.  Maybe some other creature models and animations<br />I have been looking at.</div>

In addition, taking down the servers isn't likely to help with all this rumor mill crap about ending development.<br /><br />[edited out some poo-talking]</div>

				<div class="content">We just have to make sure we are making constructive posts as to avoid the same thing which happened to EJ. I cannot even begin to imagine the amount of immature poo that man dealt with. At the moment I believe Morn and Part Time Modeler (a name would be nice) are doing a great job been spokes people and clearing alot of things up which Karl and such should not be dealing with. Stick I mean no disrespect but you did make a very questionable sounding title (which I think anybody with an interest in the game will click) and the substance was simply the already stated and cleared up in several previous posts. Although I completely understand the fact you were just informing your friends.<br />peace</div>

				<div class="content"><blockquote><div><cite>Stick Stickly wrote:</cite>Good point gentlemen. Just frustrated. Sorry for a useless post.</div></blockquote><br /><br />Actually I'm sorry to be so aggressive.  I've gotten so tired of these topics that i've become very defensive of a project I'm not even developing.  I looked over my posts for the past few days, and I've become progressively more barbaric in my language and attitude.<br /><br />A lot of people are very fustrated right now, and despite all of our clashes, we are all really just wanting this game to succeed.  I'm urging you and everyone else, just please be patient. also realize as a Hobby, more important things can come up.  They could move on to committed relationships, or a demanding career.  Tomorrow could find this project discontinued.  I don't want to encourage people to think of the developers as possibly ending this project, I just want people to realize that what the project is now, is what the project is.  The development team has shared this with us AND invited our feedback.  They probably could have done closed beta's for three more years, with just close local friends, and saved themselves a lot of headache, and still be FAR from doing a final release, just because of the demands of their lives, and the possible vastness of their vision of the project.  Or they might get the game functional with a huge map and gear list, and then decide to leave it at that.  Passing around the project to whoever wanted to host the server, have months of downtime at a time, much like Jerrath.</div>
