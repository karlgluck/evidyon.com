The fact that it does anything at this point (and that it doesn't crash!) is nothing short of amazing...I thought I had disabled it O.o Since I didn't, I'll just go ahead and add the notifications tonight.</div></blockquote><br /><br />My brother and I created level 1 characters, formed a party, and went to hunt.  We gained 0 exp per kill.  I logged out/in, and started to gain exp, but my brother continued to get 0/kill until he did the same.  When we hit level 2 we tried again:  now, we gained 1 exp per kill.</div>
