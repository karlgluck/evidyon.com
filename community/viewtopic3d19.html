				<div class="content">I don't think you need a game to look exactly like xen in order to get the same feel as xen. I think Evidyon so far is quite good. Karl, you have done an amazing job.<br /><br />Anyways, there's only a few things that don't make it 'feel' like xenimus to me:<br /><br />I don't feel like there's a reason to level higher due to everyone having the same gear.<br />-I like how it's relatively easy in Evidyon to find nice gear which progresses as you hunt stronger things. However, in xen, I really liked how the highest end gear was so hard to find and/or trade for. <br />Basically I like how items are now, but I'm hoping in the future that the uber rare/high end items are alot better than the good items already and much harder to find. (this gives people a reason to level up and hunt).<br />That's what bothered me about xen, if you aren't rich, your gear usually sucks (you're either rich or poor). So far in Evidyon it just takes a small bit of luck and hunting to find good enough items to hold your own with. Thus I think the current good items would be better considered as 'mid level' items which are attainable by hunting....just add in a few ridiculously powerful and rare items and much more people will want to find them <img src="images/smilies/icon_smile.gif" alt=":)" title="Smile" /><br /><br />Stats don't seem to have as much of an effect as in xen.<br /><br />Adding dungeons/shrines/mazes/bosses (whatever you can think of).<br /><br />Epic spell sounds.<br /><br /><br />Having the xen feel does not necessarily mean it has to look exactly like xen. It's about xenimus gameplay and content.</div>

				<div class="content"><blockquote><div><cite>kelchy wrote:</cite>...an alpha would fail if people didn't talk about issues/future concerns am I right?</div></blockquote><br /><br />Yes, you're right.  However (this isn't directed at anyone in particular) I would prefer that criticism be leveled in a constructive fashion.  Kelchy, the way you phrased your comment on gear was perfect:<br /><br /><blockquote><div><cite>kelchy wrote:</cite>-I like how it's relatively easy in Evidyon to find nice gear which progresses as you hunt stronger things. However, in xen, I really liked how the highest end gear was so hard to find and/or trade for.</div></blockquote><br /><br />You say something about how the game is now, how it could be better, and why.  This is exactly right.<br /><br />That said, Vapore is correct as well--don't get too worked up if I don't change something right away.  I have a lot of work to do, and this is Alpha after all <img src="images/smilies/icon_biggrin.gif" alt=":D" title="Very Happy" />  if I agree with your idea, I'll implement it at some point--at a time from now in proportion to how critical the feature is.</div>
