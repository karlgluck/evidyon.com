				<div class="content">Is there a map?<br /><br />I need to know some of what's going on, i keep running into trolls before any other creatures a map would be at least kind of nice, there also needs to be more spawn in the forest because I see nothing for a couple minutes at a time.   Love the other old school stuff.    Also spells dont say what they do, and the keying system sucks because if you click  you erase the keys, should have to push Del like on Xen.</div>

				<div class="content">There is no map. <br /><br />Around the spawn and just to the right there are some nightcrawlers which will level you to level 2, then trolls which are north from spawn after you've leveled off of them for a bit you can go west from spawn and follow the path until you come across a large ground of apprentice/novice mobs which are scattered all over the forest area there. <br /><br />As for the mob spawn, it is fine for me no matter where I look, not sure where you are ending up at to not find anything.<br /><br />Spell descriptions are coming and the keying system doesn't suck, however you make a valid point about clicking on spells and having it un-key the spell.</div>

Already made all the programs I need for it, just gotta start mapping out heh =).<br /><br />But yeah, Sankt's map is about right, from what I picture it to be anyway.</div>

				<div class="content">Thanks lol, i felt like i missed something but my mind seems to work better than i expected (and yeah the lakes to the east i just threw some blue spots in to indicate there are some lakes somewhere hehe).<br /><br />And noober, uhmm don't ge me wrong but tbh i'm not sure if it's worth the hassle, count me in when we have the &quot;final&quot; beta-map but atm it seems a bit too much work to me. :p</div>

				<div class="content">Woo lol. To be honest I was a little sad when I explored this world only to find that it actually became a tad bit smaller then the old map(only by like 168 y-coordinates), and then a good chunk of gas-throughable water all the way south. Whats up with that water anyway? Anything I missed there? heh..</div>

				<div class="content">Actually, this map is significantly larger.  However, you weren't able to get everywhere in the old map since you couldn't gas over the water--this map might seem smaller since you can actually walk all over it.</div>

				<div class="content">Well from the edges of the map(visible from the void, and yes, you can get to the void in this map too), the old one was 1024x768 tiles, while this one is like 1024x600, a lot of which is the useless gas-through-able water.

				<div class="content">Size info I'm getting with a program I wrote, that tells me my coords. Maybe the coords are not to scale with the real coords, but they work. And the map bounds do go to a power of 2 so I can assume that these coords have some validity to them. To get the absolute size of the map, I use this program and go into the void, and all the way to the bottom right corner, where the water edge is with the void. In the current map on this corner the Coords of my character are 1024x1024. In the old map it was 1024x512(ooo just realized 768 was a mistake on my part in the previous post. Stupid fullscreen resolutions got to my head haha) so yeah this map IS twice as big, BUT the strange water takes up a good chunk of that. If you really want me to show you it all in game, or if you want the simple C++ code to get your coords, lemme know.</div>

I added the black lines so you can see the different types of water. This is at 1000x600, and that is the size of the current map, and up until 1024x1024 its all just that water. This map IS bigger, but by very little. I could be very wrong in the case that there's something within that water(my crappy run-through it all said there isn't tho), but other then that, yeah, this is pretty much it.</div>
