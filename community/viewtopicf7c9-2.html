<br />&quot;Current work 4-7-2007
<br />
<br />I have had several emails recently asking about the next update for both the top down (TD) and first person (FP) versions of the game.
<br />
<br />First let me start off by saying that I have been working on an update for TD. It still needs some more work but is certainly in process.
<br />
<br />What I decided to do is change the modeler tool, the FP map maker, and the FP game itself over to DirectX 9. I think DirectX9 has a long development life left in it because DirectX 10 only works with Vista and the whole world is not going to move to Vista over night so game development will continue in DirectX 9 for a few more years at least. You might remember that I converted to DX9 a while back but it didn't work out that well. The EXE size went way up and didn't work well for some people. Microsoft put out a new version of the DX9 software development kit in about the middle of last year that is much better.
<br />
<br />So here is the idea behind me spending this kind of time converting to DX9. These large RPG games are way too much work for someone to do mostly alone as I have so far. So I have decided that I wont do it alone anymore. I will be posting an FP development job web page that will list tasks I need done for FP and how much each task is worth. 
<br />
<br />It might look something like this (this is only a sample and could change)
<br />
<br />New Dreg character model - $100
<br />Full set of Dreg character models with all armors - $250
<br />New dungeon in area Xxxxxxx with cave theme - $200
<br />New dungeon in area Xxxxxxx with tomb theme - $200
<br />Good side main city street layout with outer wall - $300
<br />
<br />If you decide to help with FP then you would send an email with the job you want and if the task is still available I would send you the 3D modeler or the Map maker. The jobs would have to be done within a reasonable amount of time and approved by me. Once approved then THE FP GAME owes you the amount the task was worth. What that means is you get paid a % of the game profits until the amount the game owes you had been paid to you. Of course right now FP is free and it will stay that way for a while. Yes the 3D modeler and Map maker will use version control and encryption so they don't get misused.
<br />
<br />I will be advertising these jobs on several message boards where game development types of people go, so there may be people working on FP that have never even played Xenimus.
<br />
<br />This method of doing things gives everyone an interest in making the game successful. 
<br />
<br />FP is just too big for me to develop alone so if nobody is interested in helping then development will stop. 
<br />
<br />There are many different paths this plan could take.&quot;
<br />
<br />
<br />I'm in no way saying people should focus on Xen over PV, but we have some very skilled models here who could pound out some models in a short time, making hundreds for PV.</div>

				<div class="content">Hey Necro,
<br />
<br />Thanks for looking out for us, but in prior talks with EJ he made us this offer personally, and we declined for a few reasons:<ul><li>It is likely we would NEVER get paid (FP will be free for the foreseeable future, and we would only get a cut of *profits*)</li><li>Deving for EJ is basically aiding our competition</li><li>It would take too much time from PV</li></ul>
<br />
<br />Although any modelers who feel like it are welcome to work on whatever they want (I'm not trying to tie down all of our friends here <img src="./images/smilies/icon_smile.gif" alt=":)" title="Smile" />) but I found the offer to be a bit strange.</div>

				<div class="content">Yeah I agree with Karl. This offer does seem a tad odd. I think EJ is trying to get basically free labour out of people. I really do doubt that FP Xen is ever going to be profitable. It would need a hell of alot of work to ever be solid enough to develop anything for.</div>
