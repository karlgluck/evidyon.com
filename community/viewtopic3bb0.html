				<div class="author">by <strong>Karl G.</strong></div>
				<div class="content">fixed so far for next update:<br />- items disappearing too quickly <br />- You can equip multiple items of the same class however it is only graphical, when you log off and back on only the last item you equipped will actually be equipped.<br />- Item descriptions don't refresh when an item moves out from under Player's cursor (such as with scrolling--I think this has been fixed for others).<br />- Can't walk on flowered tiles in Monstrosity area (they get stuck here). (?)<br />- Scrolling is not intuitive: Player must click in the box through which he wishes to scroll (but careful not to click on an item he doesn't want to move/drop/equip/unequip/&amp;c!); when he does move an item, scrolling ceases to function until he moves his cursor off the box.<br />- Scrolling through lists is very slow.<br />- defense<br />- Shields and helmets are not properly attached to the character models. Swords stand out a bit, most noticeable when running.<br />- mesh scaling</div>

				<div class="content">Both are on the Issues list.<br /><br />Strange graphical bug I've seen once in a very long while.  Probably nothing to worry about&#058;<br />One spell will trigger the animation of another in addition to its own animation.  I've seen this two ways:  casting Multi Ignis and in addition to the fireballs the white teleport circles flash about; running with Velo on and puffs of green will trail behind me, somewhat like Putesco.<br /><br />Have you seen these, Karl?</div>

Karl, you know what I'm talking about.<br />* The graphical representation of a fallen item can disappear prematurely--so that there's no model on the ground, but the item is still there and can be picked up.<br />* Items can not show up in inventory.  I recently logged off/on to find a handful of items in my inventory that hadn't appeared before, including one which I know *should* have been there--I'd dropped and picked up a stack of items previously, and when I looked in my inventory one of them had disappeared between being dropped and being picked back up; it reappeared on log-off/-on.<br /><br /><br />Issues:<br />* While attacking, Player cannot cast a spell while weapon is in mid-swing.  This makes it difficult as Player has to time his spell casting or move to break out of attack-mode.  Spell-casting should break Player out of attack-mode.<br />* %HP/MP items are calculated on the HP/MP <span style="font-style: italic">including bonuses</span> Player has when the item is donned instead of base HP/MP.

If you want to see this in action go pick any clear area with monsters that can't hurt you around and watch how they try to surround you:  eventually you should have 4 attacking you (I'm not sure if any more than that can fit around Character).<br /><br /><blockquote class="uncited"><div>One more thing, when you get hit it basically stops you from doing anything and I find that to be rather annoying.</div></blockquote><br />I'm not sure what you mean--could you explain a bit more?</div>

				<div class="content">I mean it makes it so you stop hitting and can't constantly spin.  Another thing I don't like is that spinning completely stops you when you spin while walking.<br />Also, the area monsters cover is way too big for their graphics.  Basically when you are fighting monsters you are both attacking air in front of eachother.  This is also annoying when you are trying to run by stuff, because you have to be further than you should need to be.</div>

				<div class="content"><blockquote class="uncited"><div> [being hit by a monster] makes it so you stop hitting and can't constantly spin. Another thing I don't like is that spinning completely stops you when you spin while walking.</div></blockquote><br />I'm pretty sure that being hit does not stop Character's attacking.  As for Spin, I'll have to dust off my Knight and test it out.  The combat system is a little awkward at the moment, to be sure.  Though it does seem sensible that Character should stop moving to perform an attack maneuver.  I've added this to the Issues list.<br /><br /><blockquote class="uncited"><div>Also, the area monsters cover is way too big for their graphics. Basically when you are fighting monsters you are both attacking air in front of eachother. This is also annoying when you are trying to run by stuff, because you have to be further than you should need to be.</div></blockquote><br />I'm not certain that this could be done better than it currently is, but I've added it to the Issues list as well so that Karl can take a look at it.</div>
