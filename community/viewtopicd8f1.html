				<div class="content">Well im not here to criticise the modeler or anything, but to be honest most armors look pretty much like pajamas.<br /><br />The armors however which are &quot;finnished&quot; have to much of the good thing, by this i mean, a lightning armor doesnt really have to be entirely blue, you could mix up the colors and textures.<br /><br />My mates tried out the game and they primary reacted to fiery rainments being a chunk of fire on your shoulder, and that the armors werent completed.<br />suggestion for what it could look like:<br /><img src="../../www.primevil.fr/quake/skins/items/armor/ingame_red_armor.jpg" alt="Image" /><br /><br />The holy armor is yellow, to be honest you could easily fix the texture of that armor if you were to make it silver &amp; yellow, so it seemed more knightly.<br />Suggestion to what it could look like:<br /><img src="../../www.rovon.net/images/Deiken21.html" alt="Image" /><br /><br />Lightning armor is totally blue and its a leather, so to be honest it should look &quot;leathery&quot;, if you remember xens L armor it had only 1 lightning in the middle and some blue but was mostly brown leather.<br /><br />these are ideas to make the armors look less onesided which comes of as amature work, with different textures which outlines the armors it will look alot more pro.<br /><br />and just so nobody gets the &quot;wrong idea&quot;, im sorry for being a jerk if you think i am one, but nobody really expects these armors to be completly &quot;finnished&quot;</div>

				<div class="content">Yes I completely agree.  Make gear more realistic. In the end a leather should still be a leather, and plate should still be a plate.  Right now the armors look fruity.</div>

				<div class="content">Just keep in mind that Eric, the one modeling and animating, has no experience that I know of in this field.<br />He is doing the best he can and is still learning.  I have seen him work on the animations, they are not as simple as moving body parts around.  They consist of 50+ muscle joints connected to somewhere around 20+ bone joints.  He has to move each of them individually and tell them what to do,  I think he has done an excellent job given the circumstances.  Especcially when the developers have started back up with school work loads, and a 30+ hour a week job (Eric).<br /><br />If you would like to help out and not come off as a jerk then how about a donation to Karl.  It is not cheap paying for a server (which may be taken care of in the next 2 weeks.I am working with Karl on the server issue.)<br />Think of way you can help, talk to Karl about it, then get out there and do it!<br /><br />                          <img src="images/smilies/icon_idea.gif" alt=":idea:" title="Idea" /> <span style="text-decoration: underline">Ask Not What Evidyon Can Do For You, but What You Can Do For Evidyon.</span> <img src="images/smilies/icon_idea.gif" alt=":idea:" title="Idea" /></div>

				<div class="content">That is more like it.  I am also helping with models, but I havn't had much luck when it comes to texturing them, there is always something that is wrong.  I have been looking at <a href="http://www.turbosquid.com/Search/Index.cfm?keyword=melee&amp;media_typeid=2&amp;page_num=2" class="postlink">http://www.turbosquid.com/Search/Index.cfm?keyword=melee&amp;media_typeid=2&amp;page_num=2</a> for models but the only problem is, they can get pretty expensive, and when you are going to have over 500 items in a game, that is a whole lot of money.  I have been doing weapon models since they are pretty easy, stuff like armor and items that need to fit over a character are a whole other league, one I have not entered yet.  I have been looking for descently priced models of armor that Karl can use, but I have forgotten the format that is needed.  So Karl a little help here.<br /><br />It is much appreciated if you would look into your brothers Marzuku, they may be interested since this is a full Beta version and once promoted will hopefully start taking off.  Then the developers can start looking at graphics.</div>

				<div class="content">Ok, excellent.  KARL or ERICH, if you could post formats for item models and any specifications you are looking for, that would be appreciated.<br />KARL, you may want to start a forum on Donations to see if any more interest is stirred up.  Also include any methods of payment that you are able to accept.</div>
