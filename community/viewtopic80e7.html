				<div class="content">I use FL Studios, and these have been made using a VST plugin called Edirol Orchestral.
<br />
<br />Pretty much all the stuff i have/use can be seen on that first page in Ender's post.
<br />
<br />
<br />Karl...
<br />just for some clarification, what all will be on the main page (just the different menu options)... i take it this is the main page in the actual game, so do you want a major or minor thing, a heroic trumpet/french horn thing, or a laid back woodwindy thing, a longer actual song, or something that loops... that kind of stuff.
<br />
<br />Just let me know, and ill make that my next project.</div>

				<div class="content">Song1 worked pretty sweet in that role on the video.
<br />
<br />Also, I've decided to concentrate more on sound effects and 3d models.  Now that Silver is here having me do music when I could be doing something else would be redundant.  I'll still maintain a support role with music though, and keep Silver supplied with the soundbanks and plugins he needs.  Right now we're getting some heavy choir stuff (&quot;EastWest's Voices of the Apocalypse&quot;), and FL Studio 7 is coming out soon too <img src="images/smilies/icon_smile.gif" alt=":)" title="Smile" />.
<br />
<br />I will still finish the remake of epic3.ogg, but I'm thinking the 100% xen-music remakes (relax and danger) should just be abandoned as we are going to have no problem getting enough original content.</div>

				<div class="content">I really like the idea of this piece, but I do have a suggestion to improve it:  make the beat a bit more steady.  I think it will sound much better if you modified the part from 0:09 to 0:11 and 0:27-0:30 to keep it from &quot;dragging&quot; the beat.  The tune is groovy, but see if you could make a straight rhythm that doesn't involve a re'tard (&lt;-- accent mark to distinguish musical slowing from mentally incapable).  A better sound font for the horns might be nice, too.
<br />
<br />Overall, very good work!</div>

				<div class="content">Heh, I hate to tell you this, but there are no re'tards in.  It is a trick of the ear, because in those two spots, it is changing from a slow three pattern to a quicker four.  Im not even sure im hearing a retard, you just have to know what to listen for to understand that its just changing meter.  Ill still take a look.
<br />
<br />And when you say horns, are you talking trumpets, french horns, both...
<br />(because they're just about samples of real instruments)... ill look to see if they have slightly different ones.</div>

<br />
<br />The best brass samples I know of are in EastWest's Symphonic Orchestra Gold XP.  I use that, but I think it takes up more space/resources than Silver has on his laptop.  (for comparison, Edirol Orchestral is 30mb, while EastWest's is over 40gb, with each instance taking about 300mb of ram)
<br />
<br />My computer is only like 4 feet from Silvers (we are roommates), but every time I let him near it the little dog puts meatspin.com as my homepage.
<br />
<br />In the scheme of things the Edirol set isn't really that bad, but I'll hook silver up with Arturia Brass or Miroslav Philharmonic, which are better quality without being as over the top on resources. 
<br />
<br />Also, that last one is cool, but song1 still has my vote for intro at this point.</div>

<br />
<br />You know, listening to it again I can see what you mean.  It is definitely changing meter--but that still sounds a little off.  Can you make the meter change differently?
<br />
<br />
<br />Ender--yeah I still like song1 too, but this has a lot of potential <img src="images/smilies/icon_biggrin.gif" alt=":D" title="Very Happy" /></div>

From what I've read FL seems to be one of the best music progz out there to date. I just got FL6 Producer edition along with some plugins and packs. I understand how the program works, in the sense that you make patterns and use them in the playlist window, but that's about it  <img src="images/smilies/icon_rolleyes.gif" alt=":roll:" title="Rolling Eyes" /></div>

				<div class="content">awesome!
<br />
<br />in regards to the &quot;happy&quot; part, I have mixed feelings. It definitly jumps out at you when listening to the score, going from an adventuresque vibe to a dance-like melody (1:16-1:22), but right after that it sounds good again. So I don't know what that means lol, maybe it just doesn't fit in this song or maybe just the transition could be reworked?
<br />
<br />**EDIT: listened to it again, maybe its the clapping thats gettin me?</div>
