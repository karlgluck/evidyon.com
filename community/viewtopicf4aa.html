				<div class="content">As you might notice in the latest download, I'm considering vamping the melee system and just going for the Xenimus method.  This new system is cool from a technical standpoint, but I don't see it being very practical...I don't ever use &quot;defensive&quot; mode as I thought I would while hunting.<br /><br />Thoughts?</div>

				<div class="content">Makes Sense...especially with xenimus and xenimus type games (isometric view games in general). It's usually all about offense and the fastest, most efficient way of doing damage. Especially for melee chars.<br /><br />Either way, I think combat damage/stats/character progression/levels will take a while to balance, so I wouldn't worry about that aspect too much right now.</div>

				<div class="content">I would go back to Xen's style.. I also really liked your idea with the defensive mode but I think it changes Xen's gameplay too much from what got us addicted.. I would go back to a simple system like Xen's and even speed things up, the latest update slowed down my fig a lot.</div>

				<div class="content">Yeah I think I'm going to go back to Xen's style.  Also, the slow-down was to get things closer to Xen's style...lol.  I made a n00b and walked around a bit, then used that for the default walking speed.</div>

				<div class="content">Yeah.. I agree that the old Xen style was a bit more enjoyable. I rarely used the def shield.. <br /><br />Does this mean that when we click on the enemy we will automatically start wacking the enemy?</div>

				<div class="content">Perhaps with the same blocking system we had come up with before could still be implemented... but with a major change to it.<br /><br />1) Don't let blocking prevent you from attacking... maybe just slow down your overall attack speed a bit while blocking, but not much at all.<br /><br />2) You can walk while blocking, but not run full speed.<br /><br />3) Add more monsters to the game that give the players an actual REASON to block... monsters that charge an unavoidable attack kind of like a run attack or something.<br /><br />This should prompt fighters to block while they're going through a big group of monsters, they can just hold block and keep attacking like normal... just to help reduce the overall damage they take by a helpful bit for about 2-3 seconds of fighting that group.<br /><br /><br />- - - - - -<br /><br />Mage-type blocking.<br /><br />Perhaps instead of having this optional barrier during combat... why not make it so when you're taking damage, you can hit the rightclick key to absorb some of that damage into your character to convert it into power?<br /><br />Say the mage took XXX damage within the 5 seconds priror to the right-click.<br /><br />The mage can heal back a % of that damage instantly upon right-clicking, and part of that damage is also used to increase the power of their next attack.<br /><br />Next magical attack increased by 1% for every 80 damage received within those 5 seconds.<br /><br />The bonus would only last about 2-3 seconds... so the mage has to cast their next spell immediately after using the rightclick.<br /><br />If a magic spell is being cast on the mage WHILE they're holding the magical-recover key, the spell can be stored and if the player leftclicks while holding the button/key, it reduces the damage by the amount you'd normally simply heal back, and casts the spell instantly back to the enemy.<br /><br />This way, fighters can hold right-click and still keep using spells or melee attack while blocking, but it slows them down just a little bit...<br /><br />Mages can use the rightclick to heal themselves a little and increase their next attack, as well as cast spells back.</div>

				<div class="content">I like your idea, Draco--however, I think I am going to implement the Xenimus system first.  At some point, it was right and worked great so I'd like to try doing that first then modifying it to add fun new features.</div>
