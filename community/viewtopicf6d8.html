				<div class="content">I just thought of a really fucking cool idea.. ok, Lets say instead of taking out the battle controls or what the #### ever they're called (like shield bash and poo) why dont you make it like this..<br /><br />1st hit, normal<br />2nd hit, 10 extra damage added (battle move automaticly hits) <br />3rd hit, 15 extra damage added (Next level up battle move used)<br /><br />of course this would be with consecutive hits only, and maybe you could either take out hit ammys or<br />make it so it doesnt add alot of damage in Pvp, but a good amount Vs monsters..</div>

				<div class="content">also keep proping how it is in xen,<br /><br />and no fancy rings this will make vts worth something again hahah.<br /><br /><br />ok i have this good idea make complete sets of things<br /><br /><br />for example in xen we have<br /><br />Dirus swrd/axe/wand/armor but not Helm or shield to match the look.<br /><br />so it would be sweet to have a full set of w.e<br /><br />Also please bring back old plate/gnome models.</div>
