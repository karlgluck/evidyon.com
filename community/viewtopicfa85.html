				<div class="content">Lots of stuff contained in this update.  Download here (in about 10 minutes):<br /><br /><a href="http://www.unseenstudios.com/evidyon/download/evidyon-client-1.8.0.msi" class="postlink">http://www.unseenstudios.com/evidyon/download/evidyon-client-1.8.0.msi</a><br /><br />MAJOR GAMEPLAY CHANGE:  you no longer have to click to cast a spell; however, target IS still taken into account for spells (just hover your mouse to use Makrus, for example)<br /><br />Karl<br /><br /><span style="font-weight: bold">Bugs I found already:</span><ul><li>teleporting while running is bugged <img src="images/smilies/icon_sad.gif" alt=":(" title="Sad" /></li><li>the inventory doesn't show up at all initially <img src="images/smilies/icon_sad.gif" alt=":(" title="Sad" /></li><li>the inventory's scroll bars are hard to grab</li><li>the included map is the old version and not the one I recompiled with the fixed edges.  urgh.</li></ul><br />Sorry guys, I'm too tired to fix tonight and I've got HW to do tomorrow, but I wanted to put this out there with the new launcher and highly improved animations to see if that helps anyone's speed.  I'll see if I can fix the other bugs by offering a download through the launcher.</div>

				<div class="content">Karl don't get down, when bugs appear. Bugs happen, Humans make mistakes, and in the world of programming debugging is a part of the whole process. what you have done is beyond me. you created a game with little funding, and created your own permanent mark in the mmo world. bugs are going to happen in all your updates, its inevitable. but its our job as players to understand this and help you out the best we can. as long as you are willing to fix the bugs you have, and take suggestions then your player base will be patient and supporting.<br /><br />Just my thoughts</div>
