				<div class="content"><blockquote><div><cite>ven wrote:</cite>Fury seems to do nothing different when casted</div></blockquote><br />Yes; I haven't finished up enchantments yet and I missed this one.<br /><br /><blockquote><div><cite>ven wrote:</cite>. Also there should be a easy way for fighter types to get trans wands.</div></blockquote><br />Agreed.  I might just make the low-cost town geosid drop items like that.  I found that if I make monsters drop those wands, the current system causes every single monster to drop the wand each time it dies.  I'll find a fix for this soon.<br /><br /><blockquote><div><cite>ven wrote:</cite>I also feel that character item drop rates when a person dies is way too high.. you drop like 3 different things.. making it nearly impossible to go to the place you died to get it back.</div></blockquote><br /><br /><blockquote><div><cite>ven wrote:</cite>-there should be a delete character button as well</div></blockquote><br />There is!  Click on your character and you can select &quot;delete&quot;</div>
