				<div class="content">In new xen your hp and mp are decided by a forumla only concerning race/class/stats. I think that your hp and mp should also depend on the amound of hp and mp you had last level. So the order by which you apply stat points become important.</div>

				<div class="content">instead of stats, they could increase a variable in calculation of dmg/def.
<br />ex attack shrine gives... 10% more attack.
<br />a defense shrine gives 10% more def.
<br />magic..
<br />blah...
<br />etc...
<br />maybe some others...</div>

				<div class="content">just throwing out an idea for shrines.. instead of stat points why dont u have it like somthing you can choose.. like lets say your a barb and you have alot of hp just crap for mana.
<br />you go to a shrine and you complete it instead of geting +1intel or some crap maybe you can  Pick to have like 10% more mp. have a choice of 10%hp 10%mp 10% attack speed or damage or somthing.. idk.. lol</div>

				<div class="content">just have shrines give &quot;X&quot; amount of skill points. but have it so they are extremely hard to find. so you dont get them all and have 11ty billion skill points you need to place. this makes adding frivolous skill points more wisely or revamping the skills incase of mistakes</div>

				<div class="content">The original cumulative hp/mp system had a ton of randomness to it.  (you gained a base value, then a random amount on top of that).  I'm guessing we are throwing that out?
<br />
<br />I remember one time I got a level, and gained something like 14hp, then the server got reset and I lost that xp.  Next day I regained it and on that same level I received like a 39hp gain.  Was a sweet feeling.  (But if it went the other way, I'd have been pissed)</div>

<br />Yeah that's how it worked on gladius too.
<br />I would save right before I leveled to 2 right by the pincher pits, and then I'd kill the, get the goods and level up, and my hp and mp would be different every time.</div>
