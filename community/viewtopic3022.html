				<div class="content">i dont think we need to make this identical to old xen. Cause honestly overall old xen really was a shitty game sorry to say. But if we took bits and peices of all the good parts of xen and took out all the shitty parts this game would be great. I also hope we dont stray to far away from xenimus when making this project. thats my number 1 fear about this.</div>

				<div class="content">Debates like this are the exact reason I want to make old Xenimus *first* exactly as it was, *THEN* worry about making awesome changes.  If we keep trying to change things while this game is being developed, nothing will be produced because the code will have to keep aiming for a moving target.</div>
