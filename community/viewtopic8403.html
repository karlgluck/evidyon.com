The weirdness from spells is fixed for next update (it was a server issue), as is what I think is causing your problem with lag.  The client optimizes your movement to smooth out jitter in the server's packet stream.  One of the approximations makes you move slightly less than you should under big lag spikes, but that's been fixed.<br /><br />Another thing that I changed for next update is that I prevent &quot;glancing&quot; collisions from registering:  i.e. if you try to move past a creature, it fudges your collision circle a little. This has made movement significantly more intuitive.</div>

It looks great in the editor, but it freaks out in the game.<br /><br />As for the pit, I fixed it but I added a few new layers in the map and didn't want to recompile, since I would have to reassign a bunch of stuff.  I figured I'll just put it out in the next version (which has multiple maps!)</div>
