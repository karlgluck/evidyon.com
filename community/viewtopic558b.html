				<div class="content">Edit: changed to make one big post with concerns instead of making a crap ton of posts in the future.<br /><br />Evidyon ideas/concerns<br /><br />Disclaimer: these are not complaints, just mere concerns and/or suggestions. They may be already said before and I just missed a previous post. Please correct and/or inform me if my information is incorrect or subject to change. I will continue to update as I level up. Also I understand it's still early beta and everything is subject to change, I'm just merely pointing out things I'd like to see changed.<br /><br />-new-<br /><br />Have had some serious lag issues lately.  East of hard liches I can do but with lag, I get destroyed.  Any answer to why the lag is so bad?<br /><br />if possible, make it so you can move the hp/mp/exp bar where you want it. Sometimes I may miss my hp is low cause of far it is in the corner. Custom interface.<br /><br />this may make the game easier but what do you think about color coordinating mobs names correlating to difficulty. Example: you're exploring and you find a new area and you find mobs with red in their name. You think cool I'll check back in a few levels to see if I can take these. I've had a few incidents with mobs there were 2x as strong as the neighboring mobs and I went to attack them and they destroyed me because I had no clue. What do you guys think?<br /><br />in game map! With only areas you've discovered, nothing else. Not even black out areas that you haven't been, just land you've stepped on<br /><br />More merchants - who sell gear, pots, charms, etc. Who also buy stuff. (I haven't seen any. Outside the two on square, are there more?)<br /><br />Better walk animations<br /><br />More variety of mobs (though if I read correctly, this is a test map)<br /><br />Chaos/good alignment - mac had some good ideas. I like the one evil town where merchants have jacked up prices but should have no safe square. Outlaw points would be cool as well. Dropping 2/3 pieces of gear instead of just one or all. You don't wanna screw people over completely that will be paying to play your game but you also don't want them ruining it for others.<br /><br />Xp in general is sort of fast for a cap of 35 but again, if I read correctly Karl said 100+ levels, correct me if wrong. Party xp prolly needs to be adjusted too, seems overpowered.<br /><br />Some graphics such as walls you can get stuck in, prolly need to be fixed.<br /><br />When killed by mobs they should patrol around your corpse instead of standing on you. It'll at least give you some chance to get up and survive<br /><br />Will add more as I continue to play</div>

EVERYONE is a merchant<br /><br /><blockquote class="uncited"><div>Some graphics such as walls you can get stuck in, prolly need to be fixed.</div></blockquote><br /><br />For the most part, this has been fixed, if you find yourself getting stuck often, let Karl know where, I think this is most likely in troll cave because I don't get stuck in Crypt anymore<br /><br /><blockquote class="uncited"><div>When killed by mobs they should patrol around your corpse instead of standing on you. It'll at least give you some chance to get up and survive.</div></blockquote><br /><br />Yup, but Karl hasn't programmed behavoir into the mobs yet.  That is going to take some time when it becomes a priority.</div>

You need to be careful where you click.  The reason for this is so that you can enter pvp with only one click</div>
