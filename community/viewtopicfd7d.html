				<div class="content">Bearing in mind i'm not a writer!...this is a story/showing of how a system could be used in Evidyon!.<br /><br /><span style="text-decoration: underline"><span style="font-weight: bold"><span style="font-size: 150%; line-height: 116%;">Short Story: The Castle of...</span></span></span><br /><br /><br />Random Friends 1: &quot;hey dudes wna try taking someones castle?&quot;<br />Random Friends 2: &quot;whats a castle?&quot;<br />Random Friends 1: &quot;where you fight through lots of guards and stuff to reach the crystal to capture the castle!&quot;<br />Random Friends 2: &quot;oh cool&quot;<br />Random Friends 3: &quot;iv'e seen some guys from the castle of Argon&quot;<br />Random Friends 3: &quot;their names look cool, how many people we need?&quot;<br />Random Friends 1: &quot;well lets try getting one more guy just to be sure!&quot;<br />Random Friends 1: &quot;hey you bumsqueezer&quot;<br />Random Friends 4: &quot;wut&quot;<br />Random Friends 1: &quot;wana help taking the castle of argon?&quot;<br />Random Friends 4: &quot;k&quot;<br />Random Friends 1: &quot;cool lets rock!&quot;<br /><br />Off they trot, making their way into the depths of the castle fighting viciously through the guards with pleasure...The King being the voice of ultimate power, is the only sole with 2 right hand men known as Lords who can bear news of the castle status. Initially there are no notifications that the castle is under attack to the King or his right hand men. That is untill they breech a certain critical area...<br /><br />Player 1 (King of Argon): &quot;Guys the castle is under attack, to the castle!&quot;.<br />Player 2 (Knight of Argon): &quot;omw&quot;<br />Player 3 (Knight of Argon): &quot;comin now&quot;<br />Player 4 (Knight of Argon): &quot;sec&quot;<br />Player 5 (Knight of Argon): &quot;be there now&quot;<br />Player 6 (Knight of Argon): &quot;so what lol&quot;<br />Player 6 (Knight of Argon): &quot;ok ok im coming..&quot;<br />Player 7 (Knight of Argon): &quot;guys i'm not coming but remember the defender limit, you have to enter the gates together...into that room...and it will accept you together as the Knights defending!&quot;<br /><br />Only the King has the power to use Castle Recall...Porting him directly into the crystal room. The rest of his defending Knights have to walk into the castle gates as a group, and enter together...any amount of knights can defend at one time...only as soon as they enter together and the door closes behind them; they would be the chosen Knights. The Knights line up waiting patiently for their fellow Knights to gather as a group outside the gates...and to enter as one...<br /><br />Random Friends 4: &quot;dude this is guna fail..&quot;<br />Random Friends 1: &quot;why?&quot;<br />Random Friends 4: &quot;they will be here to defend in a sec..&quot;<br />Random Friends 1: &quot;yes and we shall rip them apart!!!&quot;<br /><br />The Knights of Argon are waiting for their fellow comrades and not only did they have to wait patently they would also have to make their way through the mazes of the castle in the same methods as the attackers without the hassle of killing guards! However, little did they know was that the leader of the random friends was the highest level in the whole of Evidyon... Swiftly the attackers progressed, dodging opening and closing doors with ease using the level as an advantage to killing guards swiftly. Whereas the Knights...well...they were clumsy and very slow to react to the situation...<br /><br />Player 1 (King of Argon): &quot;Come on men!, they are almost at the crystal OMGFFGGFG!&quot;.<br />Player 2 (Knight of Argon): &quot;its the rest of these idiots, theyr taking too long so we have to wait for them all&quot;<br />Player 4 (Knight of Argon): &quot;comin now&quot;<br />Player 3 (Knight of Argon): &quot;i'm here...waiting with Smarty&quot;<br />Player 5 (Knight of Argon): &quot;just got here now&quot;<br />Player 6 (Knight of Argon): &quot;HURRY THE F*** UP SLOW A**&quot;<br />Player 4 (Knight of Argon): &quot;god...I am...I said I was coming now!&quot;<br /><br />The Knights could now be at risk of jeapordising their well earned and hard worked captured caslte due to their lack of co-operation, formation and team-work!...On the other hand... the Random Friends were having a ball...ow in breech of the crystal room.<br /><br />Player 1 (King of Argon): &quot;Oh great guys...its KARL and company...&quot;<br />Player 1 (King of Argon): &quot;our castle is lost...&quot;<br /><br />The fight rages where the King of Argon fights for his life to defend his castle solo...whilst his Knights are prancing around playing with their barbie dolls....the King strikes a few critical blows to some of the attackers and kills them, things were looking great...that is until the a player emerges from behind his random friends...<br /><br />Random Friends 1 (KARL): &quot;I think you will find this is my castle <img src="images/smilies/icon_razz.gif" alt=":P" title="Razz" />&quot;<br />Player 1 (King of Argon): &quot;noooo...ffs&quot;<br />Player 1 (King of Argon): &quot;Oh great now i'm dead...&quot;<br />Player 1 (King of Argon): &quot;nice work guys..thanks for the help..&quot;<br />Player 4 (Knight of Argon): &quot;I was too slow?&quot;<br /><br />The leader of the random friends then steps up to the crystal room and touches it frantically...a large glow appears and a voice emerges...&quot;Welcome new King. Please identify yourself.&quot;...[King of _____]. The new King being very excited with the achievement takes great pride in naming his castle.<br /><br />Random Friends 4: &quot;dude we all died..&quot;<br />Random Friends 2: &quot;yea that sucks... <img src="images/smilies/icon_sad.gif" alt=":(" title="Sad" />&quot;<br />Random Friends 1 (KARL): &quot;Don't worry guys!, I killed the King and guess what?&quot;<br />Random Friends 4: &quot;wut?&quot;<br />Random Friends 2: &quot;whats that?&quot;<br />Random Friends 1 (KARL): &quot;We own the castle!&quot;<br />Random Friends 2: &quot;OMG NICE!?!?!&quot;<br />Random Friends 1 (KARL): &quot;I'm coming to the town, meet me there!&quot;<br /><br />Back in the town after a long hard earned victory.....<br /><br />KARL (King of Evidyon): &quot;There you go&quot;<br />Random Friends 2 (Lord of Evidyon): &quot;omg thanks Karl!, nice work!&quot;<br />Random Friends 3 (Knight of Evidyon): &quot;OMFG COOL!&quot;<br />Random Friends 4 (Knight of Evidyon): &quot;sweet&quot;<br /><br />Each member taking in the newly formed Castle...Evidyon....maybe loose perspective for a short while, when suddenly...&quot;The Castle is under attack!&quot;<br /><br />Random Friends 2 (Lord of Evidyon): &quot;you just see that KARL?&quot;<br />KARL (King of Evidyon): &quot;Errm guys...&quot;<br />Random Friends 3 (Knight of Evidyon): &quot;yes&quot;<br />Random Friends 4 (Knight of Evidyon): &quot;sup?&quot;<br />KARL (King of Evidyon): &quot;People are breeching the castle...&quot;<br /><br />Let's hope this time, Castle Evidyon are a more successful castle than its predecessor!<br /><br /><br /><br />Hope you enjoyed reading!, I had fun Writing it!<br /><br />Richard.</div>
