				<div class="content">As a fellow programmer, I understand his position about the project.
<br />He thinks that no one can produce a xenimus-like game in any timely fashion because it took him years and years or programming and design to do it.
<br />
<br />Also as a fellow programmer, I understand that a challenge is always welcome =)</div>

				<div class="content">I'm surprised that he's so mellow.  If it were me I'd at least try to talk to the people trying to recreate my game.  Either that or he's just being sneaky and is planning some massive attack on us when it is completed.
<br />
<br />By the way, as I was doing my taxes this year, I discovered that if donations reach &gt; $400 this venture becomes a business, and I have to pay 15% tax on it and start registering for trademarks and stuff, which incurs even more expense ($275!!!).  So I guess if we get more than $400 things are going to get pretty interesting around here...but we'll get there when we get there.  Let's finish this game first <img src="./images/smilies/icon_biggrin.gif" alt=":D" title="Very Happy" /></div>

<br />Intrestingly enough if donations stop at exactly 400 dollars you'll have 5 dollars left after those expenses</div>

				<div class="content">EJ doesn't pay taxes on Xenimus?  That seems unlikely, he has a very apparent and traceable record of cash flow, etc...well then again, maybe that's why he never lets it out of beta.
<br />
<br />
<br />So this brings up an interesting issue.  If more than $400 makes me a business, releasing the open source code to this project wouldn't be a very good business move...</div>

				<div class="content">An NPO has to be charitable, and even then:<blockquote><div><cite>ila.org wrote:</cite>Not all not-for-profit organizations qualify for a tax exemption. For instance, the American Heart Association is a not-for-profit corporation which would also qualify for federal tax exemption. On the other hand, a neighborhood homeowners' association is also not-for-profit but would not qualify for a tax break. Only certain kinds of not-for-profit organizations--charities, schools, churches, clubs, etc.--fall into the tax exempt category.</div></blockquote>
<br />
<br />I don't think producing a computer game is charitable, and so far, I definitely meet the IRS qualifications for being &quot;self-employed&quot;, I'm just missing the $400 income it takes to put me there.</div>
