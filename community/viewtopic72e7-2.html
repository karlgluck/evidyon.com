				<div class="content">I won't say who because he knows who he is, destroyed me in white damage warrior pvp. Now the kicker, he's 5 levels lower than me. I thought I made a good build (went with an old school xen build). I''m in full l gear, minus gloves and he was in the holy set. He also destroyed another in spec gear. Could this character be bugged? Are builds kind of whacky ATM or is his build just perfect? I have no problem admitting defeat but this seems a bit out of the line.</div>

				<div class="content">I don't care if you post the name. But seriously, (the character being Rabid Penguin), I'm beginning to wonder if my character isn't bugged myself. I was easily destroying mages at least 7 levels above me. No buffs but my own.</div>

				<div class="content"><img src="./images/smilies/icon_exclaim.gif" alt=":!:" title="Exclamation" /> Most buffs stack 4 times for maximum effect. Sorceror's armor buff adds about 10 armor and 2-3 HP/MP regen per cast. Rage/Wrath also do, I had made a habit of quad-casting this spell so I didn't notice others not doing so: If the enemy also quad-charges his rage/wrath it evens the battle out <span style="text-decoration: underline">some</span>.<br />So basically, if it wasn't supposed to stack and add up to such a powerful buff, it needs to be fixed. Otherwise, can't we just have it do maximum effect from one cast? On warriors it's a little annoying to use a charge spell 4 times. (really slow unless you have blue pots)</div>

				<div class="content">If it is intentional, it could be so a reduced buff is available quickly after buff has worn off, or after dying.  Without dispell (which the developers have decided to include in Evidyon) it doesn't make much sense for PvP.</div>
