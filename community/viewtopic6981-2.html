				<div class="content">Bottomless pits are dumb. 
<br />Lets change the way they work. It would require mapping out cave-like areas for every area of pit. When you fall down you are transported there and take some damage (maybe even fatal damage) 
<br />They can still be made very punishing, like no way to get back to where you were easily. Specifically in shrines, if you fall down the pit you should have to go back to the outside.
<br />
<br />This isnt something I expect implemented at alpha 1.0, just a thought.</div>

				<div class="content">Yeah, that's probably a good idea. I hate losing gear forever by falling down a pit. I also don't like 'secret' pits. If there is something at the bottom, you should be able to tell without falling in and waiting to dissapear.</div>

				<div class="content">I agree, those random pits in Xenimus were really annoying, and when people hinted that maybe there was something at the bottom of one, you had to fall down to make sure. I like having secret dungeons or something accesible by falling through a pit. At least its better than in Legend of Zelda games, where you lose some health or something and then reappear next to it blinking. haha those were funny and made absolutely no sense.</div>

				<div class="content">I liked those pits. If you were really an explorer, you would take the risk to find it. Then, when people ask where your top secret levelling spot was, you can say &quot;I guess you'll have to find out for yourself  <img src="./images/smilies/icon_wink.gif" alt=":wink:" title="Wink" /> &quot;
<br />last i played stupid people blabbed the locations of all the secrets, but at one point there were several spots one could go that almost no one knew about.
<br />
<br />That being said - our maps should have many secret or hard to get into areas, to make exploring interesting and rewarding.</div>
