				<div class="content">I read the story-line behind Evidyon and wondered, if it's possible we could be a follower of a certain God.<br />Just noting some of the things the Gods gave the world could represent what character you make:<br />Atragus - Life and spirit, its animal nature and natural functions (Possibly Cleric based character)<br />Thronden - Ambition and industry, productivity, strength, and endurance (Possibly Warrior/Artisan/Paladin/Thief) Still not 100% sure what an Artisan is but just added it to a group.<br />Fayan - Souls, and to some special favorites of the gods, intelligence and caring (Wizard/Warlock)<br />Xendra - Social order (I don't know)<br /><br />[Not sure if I missed any types of characters but I'm tired...]<br /><br />Just throwing it out there for a possible guild system as well. Like you can't fight with anyone following the same God or you're forced to abandon all you know and be on your own or if you follow a certain God/abandoned your former God; you can be invited by another player into choosing to join their beliefs instead of your own. (Making them an out-cast to their old God [unless they already were], and having to gain respect with their new God/faction.)<br /><br />What do you think?  <img src="./images/smilies/icon_mrgreen.gif" alt=":mrgreen:" title="Mr. Green" /></div>

				<div class="content">Atragus - Artisan/Cleric/Paladin (maybe)<br />Thronden - Possibly Warrior/Thief<br />Fayan - Wizard/Warlock<br />Xendra - Paladin/Cleric<br /><br />yes i know cleric and paladin stack, but they follow both of those things<br /><br />anyways, i dont think anything of the sort should be added, and if it was to be added it should be voted upon</div>

				<div class="content">You will be able to &quot;follow&quot; a certain God; in fact, you can follow multiple Gods.  However, it won't be in the way of GvE in Xenimus.  It will have no effect on your faction or party.</div>
