				<div class="content">We would like to welcome all our new members, and invite those interested in Unseen Studios to join our growing community.  Please introduce yourself to us on this forum.  We'll be expanding the website as time permits, but for now most of the action will be right here!  These are the forums and what they do:
<br />
<br /><span style="font-weight: bold">Lounge</span> - Talk about pretty much anything.  Try not to use profanity, and never post illegal or offensive content.
<br />
<br /><span style="font-weight: bold">Dev Blog</span> - From time to time, us Devs will post about we're doing regarding Born to Rule.  These are like mini-updates, just to let you know what we're up to.  You may comment on any posts we have made, but only we can start new threads.
<br />
<br /><span style="font-weight: bold">Born to Rule</span> - Discussion for anything about BtR.  If you have questions, cool ideas or want to help, post here!
<br />
<br /><span style="font-weight: bold">Library</span> - Particularly interesting threads from Born to Rule are moved here.  They can still be replied to, but no new threads can be created.
<br />
<br />
<br />We hope you visit us often!

				<div class="content">Born to Rule was the game Karl had started to make (with a few friends I believe?). Evidyon borrows some of the netcode and from code libraries Karl made from it, which is how it got started relatively quickly. There were some videos of it on YouTube at one time, might still be there.<br /><br /><span style="font-size: 50%; line-height: 116%;">Seriously, you don't spam lol?</span></div>
