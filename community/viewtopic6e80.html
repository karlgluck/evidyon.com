				<div class="content">My girlfriend has been working while i was on easter holidays so you bet ive grinded a while, first day i grinded monstrosities and spirits in the swamp and i found wand of starlight<br />2 Bejewled rings<br />Argent belt etc.<br />then i grinded dragons and gained a few levels and found a bug, dragons dont drop poo.<br /><br />for the next two days i grinded cryptkeepers endlessly probably grinded them above 6-7 hours now, and they have not dropped anything remotely good but i now do own about 12 aurelian platemails <img src="images/smilies/icon_confused.gif" alt=":?" title="Confused" /> <br /><br />just saying that if cryptkeepers are the monsters with new loot or whatever, make it so that i actually have a chance of finding such an item atleast 5 minuttes of those 7 hours ive been grinding, cause its freaking demotivating just mindlessly grinding without getting anything cool in return, almost feel like Joe  <img src="images/smilies/icon_razz.gif" alt=":P" title="Razz" /> (lol just kidding)</div>

				<div class="content">an update on what ive got of valuables.<br /><br />8 bejewled rings<br />4 gold rings<br />5 crystalline rings(ask if you want one)<br />2 silver rings<br />dunno how many bronze rings(ask if you want one)<br /><br />4 barracuda katana(ask if you want one)<br />4 spirit swords(ask if you want one)<br />1 spirit dragon axe<br />2 devine aegis<br />1 helm of spite<br />1 crown of talons<br />2 wand of starlight<br /><br />6-7 aurelian platemails(ask me if you want one)<br />3-4 argent belt (ask me)<br />3-4 Argent circlet (ask me)<br /><br />my storage is filled with all the sets etc, the only item i cannot find is mirror shield, but the way im grinding i think it will be on my list soon enough.<br />aint got room for more items anymore and im storing on other characters.<br /><br />just saying if ive been able to find all this poo from when i lost all my gear to bugs and the update, then hell i should have found one of the high lvl ones dont you think? <img src="images/smilies/icon_confused.gif" alt=":?" title="Confused" /> <br />unless these items you speak of are equal of omni diabolical or dirus status then lower the droprates i suggest because this is meaningless.</div>

				<div class="content">Hey Marz, yes there are more items for you to find.  You've got a lot of the higher level ones, but you're missing the rest of the crystalline set, the sleight of hand, the lion's heart breastplate, iridescent cape and a few others.  These very high level items have approximately a 1/320000 chance of dropping.<br /><br />The problem is that you've managed to get to a level beyond where I've designed things to do.  There isn't really anything to do at level 25 because I didn't expect anyone to actually GET to level 25.  That's why level 26 takes 10 million experience--it's a barrier until I get a chance to do more design.<br /><br />Next update there should be more, but it'll be mostly mid-level content, new spells, etc.  If you can suggest something that you might want to see, let me know and I'll try to work it in as well.</div>
