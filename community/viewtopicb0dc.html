				<div class="content">Not really a bug, but it's hard to pick stuff up. That's due to the allready mentioned hard-seeable items, but also due to pretty nitpicky controls. You have to exactly click the spot the items are on in order to pick them up, additionally my character also loved to just walk a few pixels past them.<br /><br />Maybe a &quot;loot surrounding area&quot; key would be helpful, just have the auto-pickup area small in size to reduce possible drop theftery.</div>

				<div class="content">You're right.  I've been having the same problem, but continued to forget to post it.  It's not a bug, but it's certainly an issue.<br />Added:<ul><li> It's difficult to pick items up:  you have to click on the exact spot, which can be difficult.  Perhaps it could be made less precise, or have an &quot;auto-loot&quot; function, press a key to loot the immediate (small-radius) area?</li></ul></div>

				<div class="content">im reporting this bug which ive tested out, well here goes <img src="images/smilies/icon_biggrin.gif" alt=":D" title="Very Happy" /> <br /><br />If you go to the crypt and find the dragons you can do this.<br />kill all the skeletons so that the dragons will attack eachother, stand right beside the dragon and vortex, hit, putesco, vis putesco(etc.)<br /><br />If you manage to kill the dragon it will give you quite the amount of experience points, i think it's about 80 000 each kill or something.<br /><br />Though the dragons dont drop loot they can be killed unlike some others may have said, i found the bug and Deathstalker can confirm it works, should be removed emediatly( at least the huge amounts of exp) and maybe replace it with alot of exp and some decent gear.<br /><br />Now Karl and Joe, what do you think off this exploit? <img src="images/smilies/icon_biggrin.gif" alt=":D" title="Very Happy" /> <br /><br />Carnage is lvl 23 and ive lvled 4 times today, 3 during testing the dragon bug.<br /><br />i think i deserve a hug! <img src="images/smilies/icon_biggrin.gif" alt=":D" title="Very Happy" /></div>

				<div class="content">* Lag is a problem right now in a large part b/c of our less-than-stellar server.  We'll be upgrading soon, which should help a lot.  That said, you're not the only person who has mentioned lag problems relative to the new vegetation, so I've added this to the list for Karl to look into.<br /><br />* The delay/can't while being attacked is common to all spells.  It's on the list.<br /><br />* Recall is supposed to work like that.<br /><br />* Added caster damage to the &quot;balancing&quot; list.<br /><br />* Lag spike in spawn area?  I don't think I've seen that one.  Has anybody else been having this problem?</div>

				<div class="content">AH! I bet I know what it is.  The game loads a ton of crap when you log in, and it doesn't handle network messages until it's finished.  As a result, the server thinks you've lagged out and disconnects you.  This doesn't happen on faster computers since loading time is not really noticeable.  I'll fix it for the update (big test tonight though)</div>

I hope the behavior would explain it--and it should, because it's a combination of your computer's AGP bandwidth, memory speed, GPU speed and processor speed that affect this.  It has nothing to do with the network connection.  Try plugging your laptop into an AC outlet and see if that helps--most laptops slow down significantly to save power when running on battery.</div>

				<div class="content">I'll update the list later, but here are a few things:<br /><ul><li>The problem with global chat and leftover text is because the text is left over with '-' in front of it, not '--', and so goes to party chat rather than global.</li><li>The problem I had thought was with the Use menu not working is really a problem with the scroll:  the Use, Inventory, and Drop menus all use the same scroll position, so when I'm scrolled to the bottom of the Drop menu, and go over to the Use menu, it looks blank.  Three separate scroll positions would be best, or at least a separate position for Use (since, really, when are you ever going to have to scroll that menu?)</li><li>Alt+tab and sound goes away.   <img src="images/smilies/icon_sad.gif" alt=":(" title="Sad" /> </li><li>Balancing is fuxed more than I'd realized, and it's all in favour of the Knight:  my lvl 10 Knight can take Spirits far easier than by lvl 18 Sorcerer.</li></ul></div>

The problem is that if you've logged in recently, the server hasn't committed your information to permanent storage on the hard drive.  If the server crashes before it does, then your stuff is lost.  Yes, this is a huge problem.  Yes, I'm fixing it for next update</div>
