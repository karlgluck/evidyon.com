				<div class="content">Hello everyone!  We're still hard at work, and although things aren't quite as active around here it isn't due to lack of development progress--Evidyon is approaching beta quickly, and I wanted to give you a bit of information on what's happening.<br /><br />First, we've solved the portals problem, and our solution is based on a system even MORE free than Xenimus's!  We will allow any location to be marked, and portals to be created to anywhere from anywhere.  Each character can have 10 marks spread throughout the world.<br /><br />I am working toward a release featuring a brand new map created with the new editor.  There is so much that has to be changed simultaneously between now and then, though, that the normal flow of updates has been interrupted.  Once the next update is released you can expect things to pick up very quickly.<br /><br />I'll post more screenshots and such as soon as I can.</div>

You can even portal directly to the end of a shrine (but won't get the bonus it provides if you do this)<br /><br />Our solution involves expanding the storyline a bit, so sit tight while we get our act together <img src="images/smilies/icon_smile.gif" alt=":)" title="Smile" />  I promise you're going to like it!!</div>

				<div class="content">i just liked non markable areas from xen, it meant nobody could #### it up for you ahead.<br /><br />Examples:<br /><br />PK'r decides to wait at shrine end to #### up for noobs going shrines and kill them at the end.<br />if you need some special monster kill this meant that nobody could just port right inn and steal em from you.<br /><br />i wanted the portal issue solved, but im feeling like the new portal system will be like cheating :S<br /><br />No offence you guys r doing a great job but just didnt like that idea.</div>

There are some areas in Xen that it was annoying to not be able to port to, but some areas were unmarkable for good reason. Another example of cheating through extremely close-to-goal marks is marking the entryway right before a crystal at a castle, multi the last few guards, and instantly claim it for yourself, right before someone else instantly took it from you using the same method.</div>

				<div class="content">That is to say that evidyon follows the exact same structure of xenimus castles <img src="images/smilies/icon_smile.gif" alt=":)" title="Smile" /><br /><span style="font-weight: bold"><br /><span style="text-decoration: underline">Sorry if none of this paragraph makes sense below</span></span><br />If it doesnt then it may be that you are actually unable to take a caslt on your own solo, it is possibly just that hard! - just on the thought of castles, what if you do have to get group of you together say 4-6 players to take a castle, maybe at the point where you can hit the &quot;crystal&quot; you are able to specify the name of your &quot;Castle&quot; and a type of &quot;clan&quot;/&quot;guild&quot;... <img src="images/smilies/icon_smile.gif" alt=":)" title="Smile" /> something I think is a little more unique than most games iv'e seen or played. This way there could be multiple types of these &quot;castles&quot; to capture, people would have their friends with them to go try and capture a castle and have their own &quot;clan&quot;/&quot;guild&quot; name. Thisd also prevents silly Guild Naming and such like &quot;Knights of Uber Duper Dooby&quot; or &quot;We are the super silly pain&quot;, you could control the &quot;castle&quot; guild naming to only 1 word like &quot;Drethor&quot; etc, instead the chosen King of the group of friends taking the castle will make a 1 word name for their &quot;Castle&quot;/&quot;Clan&quot;/&quot;guild&quot;, then he or she designates the ranks <img src="images/smilies/icon_smile.gif" alt=":)" title="Smile" />... This also will make things very competetive for castles, and guild domination. just imagine!</div>

				<div class="content">Castles would be a special situation.  Once you see how the system works, you'll recognize how we can make the world very close to 100% markable and not have any of the issues you all have been mentioning.
