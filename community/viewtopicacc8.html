				<div class="content">I've been working whenever I can but it's slow going--the end of the semester they really pile on the work.  I have barely had time to check my email let alone sit down and do real programming in the last two weeks even though I'm up every day from 8 am until midnight...so, to answer your question, there has been progress but until I dig myself out from under this pile of projects/problem sets/studying for finals/research presentation that I need to do, I probably won't be able to release anything new.
<br />
<br />I can say, however, that my next update will allow you guys to start adding a LOT more content to the game.  I've re-written almost all of the internal engine such that it takes all of its media information from external files--this means you can add see what your own models and textures look like directly in the game without submitting them to me, you can design your own walls, pits and fluids using any texture you want (want an acid bath? it takes two seconds to make one!) and you can create up to 18 completely custom palettes in the map editor that display those ground types and models.
<br />
<br />The next update will be big, and I'm still very much working on this project.  Stick around, PV is far from dead <img src="./images/smilies/icon_smile.gif" alt=":)" title="Smile" /></div>
