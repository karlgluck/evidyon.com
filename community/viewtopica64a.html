				<div class="content">Cuz i was reassigning my points and my int wouldnt go over 18. I was like wtf? So i started spamming out points on my wisdom expecting it to stop at 18 as well...but it didnt. Long story short. I fuxed my build. It was disappointing...but also mildy hilarious.</div>

				<div class="content">The reason for this behavior is that because the order in which you assign stat points matters (e.g., CON added at a lower lvl adds more HP than CON added at a higher lvl), when a player is reassigning stats he has to follow as if from character creation.  So the first 25 points (24 right now, actually, on account of a mistake) have to be assigned before any one stat can go above 18, because that's the number of points you have at character creation:  your &quot;lvl 1&quot; stats.</div>

				<div class="content">Yeah. I figured that something to that degree was the case because i had remembered reading about it, but couldn't quite remember it at the time. So do you think there is any hope of me fixing my stats soon? Cuz i wouldnt want to keep leveling and have my build all out of whack if the characters are going to move over to the Beta, but now that i think about it i could just calculate what i wanted in the long run and build up to that over time, or just wait for the next update, but both of those options just arent too satisfying.</div>

				<div class="content">I don't have an easy way to let you reassign stats right now (Karl might), and we do need to make this behaviour more clear in-game for future stats re-assignments--I've had to explain it several times now, as it's not exactly self-evident--but right now it would probably be easiest to do as Sex4Cash suggests and just re-create and hang around for a high-lvl to get in game and lvl you.  I'll be on in a little this afternoon and probably tomorrow evening as well and will be happy to help you out.<br /><br />Guys, if you could help him out if you see him before I do, it'd be appreciated.  Thx.</div>

				<div class="content">Yay for the stat reset, and yeah some kind of reminder for new people would probably be a good thing to implement. I find it very easy to click myself into a fuxed build. Hah. And to answer your question Joe, yes, I'm already planning. I like to look ahead. Oh, and I'm level 11 now. Yay.</div>
