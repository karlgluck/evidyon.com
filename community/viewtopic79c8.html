				<div class="content">I'm sorry, but it has to be said:<br /><br />Tyler is an idiot.<br /><br />Now, to be sort of on topic with problems...<br /><br />Have you found anything on why Evidyon is going nuts on some computers and not on others Karl?  This might sound odd, but could it be something like lack of video codecs or something similar that could cause it?  To my knowledge, my laptop meets &quot;minimal&quot; requirements for sure, but still gets the error.  The only difference other than hardware that i can think of would be lack of video codecs, and lack of sp2.  However, somebody said that they had sp2 and it still wasn't working, and they had the same error as i get on my laptop.  <br /><br />I will try and install it on the wife's computer (secretly...bwuahahaha).  I'll see if i can duplicate the message.</div>

				<div class="content">burnt, please dont flame in any topic where we are trying to help someone... noone called you anything when you had a problem, anyways<br /><br /><br /><br />one reason it goes wacko on some comps and not others is because of A their connection, B their DX, C, where they installed it to, and D, their computer itself<br /><br />and just because your laptop can run a game like WOW doesnt mean it can handle evidyon correctly, different graphic styles are rendered differently (as far as i know) so lets say WOW would run smoothly, you think &quot;oh sure i can handle evidyon&quot; boom, evidyon slaps you in the face by not working, thats because wow doesnt rely as heavily on processer speed as evidyon does, Wow is constantly mapping out the land as you move, updating and tweaking everything, evidyon however does nto (yet), Wow also has an options menu to make it so your comp can handle it better, evidyon doesnt:) btw for those who DONT know (alot of u do) wow=world of warcraft<br /><br />i personally have sp2 and i'm on a cruddy comp atm, and i havnt had ANY problems with evidyon (other than lag and the random lack of skins on exoteric and darvali/gendran) but thats due to my video card coughing and being old and sick lol</div>

				<div class="content">I wasn't calling him an idiot because he has a problem or because he can't fix it.  I just can't stand him in game.  He is a complete jackass in game but then he comes on the boards asking for help.  <br /><br />That was my only reason.  Sure, I suppose it was unnecessary, but so are his actions in game, and so is the fact that he uses a glitch to not lose gear when he dies.</div>

				<div class="content"><blockquote><div><cite>ascent wrote:</cite>and just because your laptop can run a game like WOW doesnt mean it can handle evidyon correctly...</div></blockquote><br /><br />Unfortunately, this is true.  Evidyon uses a lot of CPU time because I'm trying to support older systems with crappy gfx cards.  I've addressed this at length in another post, but the jist of it is that I'm going to need to make different versions of Evidyon to run on newer hardware.  Ever notice how some people with awesome gfx cards still get the &quot;indexed matrix blending not supported: using software device to compensate&quot; error?  It's because these sweet gfx cards have stopped supporting some of the older techniques that I still use for compatibility's sake.<br /><br />At this point, I'm trying to make the game better for the people for whom it works.  The technical issues I feel can better be resolved when the code base is more stable--fixing this today might cause more problems in the future if I fix it the wrong way.</div>

The tyler from in game does nothing but stand at the square harrassing people, saying &quot;come on&quot; to them every 20 seconds and then getting upset when he gets killed over and over. His character also appears to be bugged as he very very rarely, if ever, drops gear when we kill him.  He is just plain annoying.</div>

				<div class="content">There are currently some issues with video-card compatibility.  Upgrading is <span style="font-weight: bold">not</span> the answer:  Evidyon doesn't play nice with newer cards at the moment.  Karl opted for compatibility by using slightly older technology, but then came to find out that a lot of newer cards (such as the one on my machine) don't support that older technology anymore.  It doesn't kill the game for me, but it does force software rendering, which is pretty far from ideal.</div>
