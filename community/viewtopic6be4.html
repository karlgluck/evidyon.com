				<div class="content">I wanted to keep everyone up to date on the status of the latest update.  Well, story is that a bunch of work snowballed right at the end of this week (lab reports, assignments, tests...), and I was feeling pretty sick today and still had to do some chores as well as finish up homework that is due today &amp; monday.  I'm still coding the changes for this update and probably won't get a chance to finish this weekend.  I'm kinda disappointed.  I'll try for next weekend, though--we've got a (short) break coming up!<br /><br />Thanks to everyone who continues to post on the forums and check out the game.  It's your support that keeps me going!</div>

				<div class="content">No problemos chief karlito, no hurries and don't stress yourself.<br />If you do stress yourself too much about it you might get ill and eventually die. Then we never would be able to experience all the funky stuff you're working on.<br />So you see, it's in evidyons own interest that you don't push yourself too much and take it easy. And ahyeah, you stay healthy that way too. :J</div>
