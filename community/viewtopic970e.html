				<div class="content">earlier tonight i was thinking about how my xenimus account was hacked...
<br />
<br />Karl, is there a way of recording what isp logs on to an account? and is there a way of recording that information, and or tracking it? 
<br />
<br />that way when someone says they were hacked you can just look up what computers have gained access to their account. and see what accounts that computer has access to. that way you can trace gear, delete the proper accounts... (the ones the hackers actually play, not some noob account) ...and possibly even block an isp address.
<br />
<br />just trying to think of ways to make it a cleaner atmosphere to play. 
<br />
<br />Ej always claims he will delete accounts if they are found to be cheating... it is VERY rare he acctually does... anymore.</div>

				<div class="content">Yes, it's very easy to track who has logged on.  In fact, you HAVE to know the IP of the client who logs on in order to send messages to them--whether or not EJ's code writes this down...well...that's a different story.</div>

				<div class="content">EJ's code does save is somehow, thats how he finds botters. He just goes through the list of IP's and looks to see if any of them have sent the same packets alot.</div>
