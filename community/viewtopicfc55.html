				<div class="content">im just saying it sucks.<br /><br />if i dont have a guild i dont get port scrolls, if i lose gear i cant get back to it unless some one gives me or i find it in bazaar wich nobody does because nobody buys from bazaar, the merch should sell these on a regular basis.<br /><br />Try finding one good point about this system:<br /><br />betting this will pop up &quot;players will set up the economy&quot; what if 1 guild decides to not share? then bye bye to all melee characters because they wont have a chance in hell to get porters, this makes every melee a fail if he doesnt have caster friends.. kk thnx bb<br /><br /><br />Besides, a caster can already fast port clear marks if he wants, a melee character has to use drops for this... quiiiiite imbalanced since porters cant be gotten anywhere but guild geosid.</div>
