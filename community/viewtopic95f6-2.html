<br />
<br />I already adressed this. everyone starts in semel, and they can change their hometown later. (once they GET to those places)
<br />Semel used to be the most populous city.</div>

				<div class="content">got to agree with vitriol on this one. if everyone started in the same town, you could actually make a &quot;chain&quot; of quests starting in that town. new players will not know that aridus is the town where u can find most people, and you will have them spawn in towns with no people and get bored fast. having everyone start at same and make that a &quot;base&quot; for players up to lets say lvl 8 or something, you will have players who can communicate and help new ones.</div>

				<div class="author">by <strong>Joe M.</strong></div>
				<div class="content">hmmm...interesting idea.  I tend to favour choosing your own town, but the point about a quest-/help-chain is a good one.
<br />The problem with that is that it gets tedious for older players, and can lead to crowding and awkwardness.  On the other hand, imagine the game while there are still very few players--it would be way too spread out.  Perhaps a compromise--have a &quot;recommended&quot; town that is the default, with a tag explaining that it's the best idea for now/for new players?
<br />
<br />If not that, then a lock on other towns until a certain player-density is reached.</div>

				<div class="content">honestly the addition of aridus into xenimus is a new one to me. I dont think aridus should exist. maybe a dungeon or a ruin where aridus is now.
<br />Semel and terthius should be the most populous towns. 
<br />Semel for being the starting town, and terthius for having the best merchants.</div>

				<div class="content">I agree w/ Vitriol here. A mistake EJ had made quite early into Xen was disconnecting the enviroment in regards of starting in random towns. This threw new players off, put a dent on the community, and erased a starting point in the storyline. Players need a common ground that brings everyone together, a central townsquare. Semel was great because it literally was Town 1 and knowing so gave you a sense such as &quot;ok so this is where the game starts.&quot; From there one could make his/her first couple levels and eventually team up with some other strong players to attempt to make the trip to T2. 
<br />
<br />Me and Karl had a discussion about this once on aim and we liked the idea. Another plus to this is workload becomes drastically reduced. Rather than worry so much about content outside the first continent we can now put more effort into creating quests that can guide players lvl1-10 and give them a story.
<br />
<br />I don't believe Karl has decided just how much of a clone this will be yet. It's safe to say at least 95% of the old xen gameplay and mechanics will be directly duplicated but as far as whats beyond that, no one knows. Keep in mind the goal of Unseen Studios was originally to create their own game. I wouldn't be suprised to see some Unseen influence into project Volucris ;P</div>

				<div class="content">Kuba I want your manbabies. 
<br />You have hit the nail right on the head. 
<br />By having everyone start in the same place, it fosters a sense of community VITAL to the xenimus feel. If a player spawns in palus, they are going to think the game is EMPTY, because NO ONE goes to palus.</div>

				<div class="content">starting towns have little to nothing to do with where the community gathers. its real only relevance is for where you respawn when you lose xp and where you fight rogues and skeletons before you can port yourself around.
<br />
<br />People managed to find a common gathering place nowadays even with all the different towns you can choose from. Everyone is either in t7 or cons merch.
<br />
<br />I wouldn't care if everyone spawned in semel as long as there are a couple teleporters to more low key towns that you can store in when youve just lost bag/lsa or whatnot. General grief poo like pking people at storage should be avoidable if the person wants to take the time to go to another city.</div>

				<div class="content">The only thing about starting towns is if everyone only gathers in one town, but your starting place is random, if you are real new player and you don't see even one person around, you probably will get frustrated and quit unless there is a very very good help/guidance system.
<br />
<br />We will definitely need a few people to write a newbie help guide/quest system.</div>
