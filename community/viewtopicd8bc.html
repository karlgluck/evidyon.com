				<div class="content">Yeah Transing is definitely gliched somewhere, has cost me about 20 grand in exp penalties today. I'm going to try and describe it the best that I can.<br /><br />When I cast the spell my cursor switches to wand and then when I click I don't port.  Everything else on the screen is moving just fine, but I can't log out or do anything else but click with my wand until I die.  This only happens when I'm transing so as far as I can tell it is not lag.  Mostly happens when I'm on the same map as the main town, but it's been happening more and more frequently in Ancient Land Map, I don't think it has ever happened to me in Troll Cave map (the one by main town, after the portal.)<br /><br />Oh and if it happens when I'm not hunting it lasts only a few seconds.</div>

It seems like they work...but only sometimes and I haven't figured out what that sometimes is.  You can trans into a pit using a wand, and out of one using a wand--but you can't trans from place to place in a pit using one.  Sometimes.  I'll figure it out asap and get back to you.</div>

If your character can't level up anywhere else, then you can't explore, can't pvp, the character you made needs to be scrapped and revamped, or you need to regear.<br /><br />Plus on the levels that it's good exp, you need to leave the square a few times to gather enemies to make it really worth it.  This gives plenty of chance to die.</div>

				<div class="content">When everybody was hanging out in one square I had some huge trans lag, seemed specifically when people were attacking skeleton.  Probably no surprise there but I think it might be something to test to see if we can get 3 or for people attacking skeleton if it stops people from being able to trans.<br /><br />Idea- When Dmg shows up after attacking skeleton it spams the chat list.  It makes following a conversation kind of hard if your using the Box.  If it could be prevented from showing up in the box that would be great.  There is no where on the square or even in the town that you can get away from the spam text.</div>
