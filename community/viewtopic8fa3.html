				<div class="content">i have a few ideas bout the game <br /><br />1. are we gonna have those stupid battle moves? i really dont see the point in them dont they just take up programming time?<br />2. on the wep's will all class have access to the same type of weps? (i.e. arc sword, axe, staff, claymore, rapier, and so on..)because i think bars get f*cked on wep choises<br />3. str req's on armors i think if u wanna wear it u should fork the extra stat pnts for it as of now the only leth i know of uses 15 str y just 1 leth?<br />4. now that im ontopic bout lethers will we get more choises on armors for low lvls as well as high?<br />5. im not sure if it's on another topic but will the next update include a merchant?</div>

I was told that Karl was deleting all the skills, and just scripting New ones.. so No<br />2. Evidyon doesn't have a barbarian class.<br />3. Well I think if this happens, then and class should be able to wear any armor, so if a Mage has 25-30 strength it should be able to wear heavy plates.<br />4. I'm sure there are gonna be more/different armors to choose from. Since currently there's only like 10 give or take a few <br />5. Doubtful..  <img src="./images/smilies/icon_confused.gif" alt=":?" title="Confused" /></div>

				<div class="content">1. no, but there will be some interesting combo moves<br />2. &amp; 3. all classes can use all items, there are only stat requirements<br />4. creating the data for a new item takes about a minute, so Evidyon is going to have a TON of items<br />5. I am trying to fix the bazaar for next update.  Merchants will be rare, and more like traveling salesmen--they'll have a couple of items once in a while, and be willing to buy a couple of items once in a while.  They'll act more like people hawking items than the stoic merchants of Xenimus:  wandering around town saying what they have, what they're buying, etc.</div>

I wanna actually see many many changes in Evidyon that make it stray further from Xenimus, rather then being another Xenimus clone. Xenimus IS really outdated, afterall.</div>

Take the cool parts and add stuff to make it unique/better.<br /><br />That said, I make every decision keeping in mind that I'd like to please as much of the Xenimus crowd as possible--remember, I loved the game at one point too <img src="./images/smilies/icon_smile.gif" alt=":)" title="Smile" /></div>

				<div class="content">Karl just has to be VERY careful when deciding what should and should not be in the game. I mean, look at Xenimus. Most of the things that sucked bum about it were OUR idea... heh.
