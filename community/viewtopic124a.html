				<div class="content">So, I was supposed to fly back on Sunday but after 4 planes had &quot;mechanical problems&quot; our flight was canceled.  I spent 9 hours in the airport yesterday and another 7 (so far) today, so I've had a lot of time to code.  As a result, I'm done networking the main menu screen and PV has a login server that is up-and-running.  It can hold characters (create and delete), manage accounts (create, retrieve, change password), process logins, give out current/max player information and handle disconnections.  I'm finalizing that process right now and will be cleaning it up in the next week or so...after I do my homework and find some food.  Hooray for having no groceries on the first day back after a trip!
<br />
<br />Just out of curiosity, has anyone found new textures/models for the project?  Also, where is silvert?  I've got the OGG library set up on my computer and I'm ready to add his stuff to the game fairly soon.
<br />
<br />Karl</div>

				<div class="content">I'm hoping to have something resembling a beta out by the end of the summer (2 months).  After all, I'd like the beta to be something other than a glorified chat room (if I had more time--I'm swamped with homework from my summer class--I'd have that out this weekend).</div>

				<div class="content">take ur time a rush job can lead to many mistakes/bugs, i would rather wait to play a good clean game, then one that crashes everytime i click on npc or something.  <img src="./images/smilies/icon_biggrin.gif" alt=":D" title="Very Happy" />
<br />
<br />on that thought can u make it so guards dont hate you? if u hit them. i konw alot of people who tried xenimus gave up same day because the guards attacked them over and over and over....
<br />can you make it so guards will only take damage from hated chars, and will not attack or do dmg to a good char?</div>
