				<div class="content">I'm not sure how often it backs up right now.  Previously, I believe it was every 15 minutes.  But remember, once we get this release stable and bug-fixed, we're planning on doing daily wipes for about a week so that we can test balance (e.g., do the Adepts have enough HP?  Do the Sorcerers deal enough damage?  Do the Hunters get *too* fast?).<br /><br />I quote from <a href="http://www.unseenstudios.com/community/viewtopic.php?f=28&amp;t=2642&amp;start=0#p12445" class="postlink">Karl's post at the start of the thread</a>:<br /><blockquote class="uncited"><div>Because we are still trying to figure out how to balance everything, make sure the game is stable and make it more fun (!!) we need you guys to help us test.<br /><br />To this end, we will be doing reset-tests of the game until next week. Each day expect to log in to a completely wiped server with fixes based on your feedback from the previous version. You can get in, play, test things out and let me know what needs to be fixed here on the forum. Once Pre-Beta starts, we will start the &quot;official&quot; version where you get to keep your characters, and we will start adding content/maps/spells/etc and increasing the level cap as fast as we can.</div></blockquote><br />We designed all the numbers in the abstract (part of this release was a complete design overhaul, which created a coherent mechanics for the game), but they need a good bit of testing.  Now we're not going to hang out at this (fairly limited, content-wise) stage endlessly, but we do need to make sure that they're <span style="font-style: italic">mostly</span> in balance before we proceed.  Basically, with this release we're building a nice and solid foundation upon which future versions of Evidyon will rest (Pre-Beta, Beta, Commercial); if we rush forward now, we're all going to regret it later when we've got a junky and incoherent system that doesn't play smoothly.</div>

				<div class="content">Hey everyone!<br /><br />The server backs up every 30 minutes--but I'm reducing that to 10 minutes as of this upload I'm doing right now.  Other things that have been fixed include: monsters dying in water and dropping items in water appear correctly now, I fixed another potential crash bug (allocating lots of memory O.o) and I've made chaos less dark.</div>

				<div class="content"><blockquote class="uncited"><div>Only major problems are the level 10 cap and the seemingly small map.</div></blockquote><br />This is deliberate.  As y'all have been experiencing, there are still a good number of bugs to work out with the game.  Once those get worked out we'll take a little time to make sure our numbers are in place.  Then we add content.  It would be counter-productive to have a lot of content at this stage:  as it is, we can easily focus on the issues and get them fixed quickly.<br /><br /><blockquote class="uncited"><div>Oh, and lack of anything but weapon and / or shield showing up on character, but I heard that's being fixed.

				<div class="content"><blockquote><div><cite>Immortal wrote:</cite>when will we be able 2 /lead ppl so i can join with my friend</div></blockquote><br />There was a problem with parties crashing the server.  I don't know whether or not it was fixed with today's update, but if it wasn't, Karl may have disabled parties temporarily.  I believe that guilds work, though.  Check <a href="viewtopic2034-3.html" class="postlink">the instructions post</a> to make sure you're using the correct commands.<br /><br /><blockquote><div><cite>ven wrote:</cite>Can I report bugs here or do you guys want me to pm them?</div></blockquote><br />Well, it looks like the bug forum is still locked, so you can go ahead and post them over <a href="http://www.unseenstudios.com/community/viewtopic.php?f=28&amp;t=2647" class="postlink">here</a>.</div>
