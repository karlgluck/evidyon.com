				<div class="content">It's going well.  I'm integrating the new world editor into a reconstructed framework of the old game, and the results are very promising so far.  Right now I'm figuring out how best to design the game world itself.  In short, I hope to have a release of the new Volucris out by the end of my winter break (mid-January)</div>
