				<div class="content">It can get a lot moreso, too <img src="images/smilies/icon_smile.gif" alt=":)" title="Smile" />  This is just my little demo that takes about...3 minutes to build from scratch.  That's how easy the new editor is!  Plus it lets you draw right in it and do all sorts of fun things.  When we meet next in person (I'm in town tomorrow all day and back on the 22nd!)  I'll show it to you <img src="images/smilies/icon_biggrin.gif" alt=":D" title="Very Happy" /></div>

I mean, well the tool doesn't have to be public, but I think you should give it to a few alpha testers.. Couldn't hurt</div>

				<div class="content">Yeah, there's still a lot more to do on this editor--I'm adding a special FX editor tonight and if all goes well I want to release a few videos.  I'll be going away on vacation until the 22nd, so I will be out of touch until then.  All the more reason to get this finished up before-hand <img src="images/smilies/icon_smile.gif" alt=":)" title="Smile" /><br /><br /><br />As far as releasing the editor goes, the way I am reassembling the game should make it really easy to release a public version that interested people can play with.  Unlike the one I'm coding now, a public version would be able to create new maps just by loading the game file that's distributed with every client program.<br /><br /><br />Anyway, here's a list of the <span style="font-weight: bold">new</span> things that the Evidyon editor can support, as of today.  Most of these integrate directly into what you all will see, some require a bit more coding (ex. swimming) but will definitely be implemented:<br />- arrows and other physical projectiles<br />- lights of all sorts, both ambient (day/night, sunrise/sunset, dungeon) and local (flickering torches, spells)<br />- mesh-based special effects (ex. the Fragor explosion)<br />- attaching special effects to objects, including items!  sparkly swords, burning armor, dripping axes...<br />- &quot;shadowed&quot; areas of the map<br />- walls that can't be transported over<br />- secret walk-through walls<br />- swimming</div>
