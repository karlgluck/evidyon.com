				<div class="content">So I'm still working on the spell system.  Actually, I figured out a nifty way to combine the spell, combat, consumable item and equipment systems together so I'm doing them all at once.  I've got most of the design and code finished, but I'm tweaking things a lot because I'm trying to make sure the system is balanced.  So that's why I haven't released another movie yet...I've got a bunch of cool effects going on, but I want to make sure that what I show you is similar to what's actually going to end up in the game <img src="images/smilies/icon_smile.gif" alt=":)" title="Smile" /><br /><br />Karl</div>
