				<div class="content">Karl, your doing alot of work and thats great. But i personally cant help but feel you've strayed to far from xen with Evidyon. Wasn't the original idea to recreate old school xen, or to just recreate xen period? When i play Evidyon it doesn't feel like xenimus to me really, and some of these new additions your talking about i dont like at all. (zooming and rotating screen? No thanks...) <br /><br />Personally i wish you would go back to trying to make this a Xenimus Recreation, as opposed to a TOTALLY different game, with a slight link to xenimus. I know some others agree, lets have a poll and see.</div>

				<div class="content">The point of Evidyon was never to be a clone of Xenimus. It was always going to be a completely new game but it would have the feel of Xenimus, for example the fast paced action and pvp'ing, the exploration, cumulative stats, etc. <br /><br />Though I do slightly agree on the camera, it detracts from the feel of Xenimus. However it is interesting.</div>

				<div class="content"><blockquote><div><cite>9sam1 wrote:</cite>When i play Evidyon it doesn't feel like xenimus to me really</div></blockquote><br /><br />Yes, I know.  I am making an effort to make it &quot;feel&quot; like Xenimus, and I believe a lot of that has to do with (1) the spells that are available and (2) the graphics style.  I am working on making it feel more like Xenimus; I know exactly what you mean--however, my goal is to make a game that is as close as I can get to same feel but is not a clone.  Think about it--a clone would be boring.  You know all the secrets in Xenimus.  You know the best character builds.  You know the available spells, skills, and items and where everything is in the world.  That's what I'm going to change, and I want to add improved graphics and make it easier to become immersed in the game.<br /><br />I realize that this project has strayed from that, but it has because my main goal is to make this game *work* first.  The biggest problem is what IS the style of Xenimus?  I can tell that it's different, but I can't figure out what specifically to change.<br /><br />After playing with the new camera, I think it might be best to keep it fixed, however.</div>

				<div class="content">I don't really see this as a problem. To be honest i prefer the overall current 'feel' of evidyon over xenimus.<br />And i'm not sure what defines the 'xenimus feel' for you. The only thing you mentioned is the camera, i have a hard time seeing that as a problem because afaik they're supposed to be <span style="font-style: italic">additional</span> perspectives which you're not forced to use (hunting might be difficult with it anyways).<br /><br />To me, xenimus biggest points that defined the 'feel' for me allways were: <br />- Fastpaced Gameplay (&quot;Action MMORPG&quot; - The old arcade &quot;Gauntlet&quot; allways comes to my mind)<br />- Anarchic rulesystem with basically no restrictions<br />- No instancing<br />- A slight humorous, self-ironic touch (which unfortunately seems not intended in xenimus though lolz)<br />- You can get most things done playing alone<br /><br />I pretty much found all that in evidyon aswell. With combos, guaranteed item-dropping and shrubberys i also see improvements in the different fields. But ofcourse, that's just my personal opinion, after all this is art so personal taste comes into play. :p<br /><br />Edit: Concerning the camera, how about to just add one or two good perspectives to the &quot;v&quot; key? For example the rotating one or a close-up one/free perspective to admire the glitzy gear you're wearing?</div>

				<div class="content">A direct clone of 'old school' xenimus (which you somehow didn't bother to define further) would majorly suck imo.<br />I also thought everyone agreed on having a new game that uses the xenimus 'feel', to which extent is still a adjustable thing in an <span style="font-style: italic">alpha</span>.<br /><br />And i'm not sure if it helps your case when you make a thread on xentales asking to vote for 'yes' on here while most people on there don't even know how evidyon 'feels'.<br /><br />Sidenote: polls on this forum aren't very reliable anyways since every new-ip-guest can submit a vote.</div>

				<div class="content">That actually was my point. You think the evidyon 'feel' is not like it should be so you ask people who never experienced that very 'feel' to give their opinion (but you didn't see me locking the thread so i obviously am fine with it, i just don't see much of a benefit).<br />And nobody donates anything to me (which sucks badly :/), i also don't believe karl is just in it for the donation as you seem to suggest it here (Note: i have <span style="font-style: italic">nothing</span> to do with the development of evidyon, i'm just an alpha tester just like you who stated <span style="font-style: italic">his</span> opinion.)</div>

				<div class="content">It was my understanding that, pv would<br /><br />remake the xenimus models, textures, sounds etc. And make the game just like Xenimus with slight changes to avoid legal problems. (renaming omni to something else, but having it look like omni)<br /><br />Honestly the problem comes mostly in the look i suppose, Your brain responds a certain way to the look of xenimus, if you remember my Xenimus 2d project, the engine was nothing even slightly close to xenimus, but i used alot of things to make some of it look like xenimus, and people played. So i've drawn from that and other things, that the look is what REALLY makes it feel like xenimus.</div>

The thing is, I've coded almost every single day for the past TWO YEARS on this game, so I'm pretty excited to have something that actually *works*.  And I do recall saying that alpha would be open to players who would help me find bugs in the code and provide helpful suggestions without passing judgment because <span style="font-weight: bold">the game is not (in any way, shape or form) finished!</span><br /><br />That said, if you or anyone else would like to suggest some specific changes please let me know.</div>

				<div class="content">Finally you managed to get to the cake hehe.<br />I'd still prefer new models and textures over &quot;slightly modified&quot; xen-originals though, same goes for other visuals.<br />Just seems too boring to me to end up with a game that looks like a polished &quot;2.0&quot; version of the same stuff we allready seen for years. Half of the fun is  learning and (especially) seeing something fresh.<br /><br />I guess that's the &quot;taste&quot; part though, because to me the xenimus 'feel' derives of the gameplay/rulesystem elements and not so much from the visual part.</div>
