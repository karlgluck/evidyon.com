				<div class="content">Yeah the sound got messed up last update; I found the problem, but haven't uploaded the fix yet.<br /><br />Deleting a character doesn't work.  It actually just crashes you out of your account, so it will remain active for ~30 seconds, then you can log back in.  Yet another something I have to fix :/<br /><br />I'm glad you like the keys and crossbow <img src="images/smilies/icon_biggrin.gif" alt=":D" title="Very Happy" /></div>
